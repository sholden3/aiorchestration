# Fix Implementation Plan

**Orchestrated by**: Alex Novak & Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Created**: January 2025  
**Status**: ACTIVE

## Priority Matrix

### üî• Critical (Week 1)
- **C1**: Terminal Service Memory Leak
  - Owner: Alex Novak
  - Impact: Memory exhaustion in renderer process
  - Implementation: Add proper cleanup in service destruction
  
- **C2**: Cache Disk I/O Failure Cascade
  - Owner: Dr. Sarah Chen  
  - Impact: Complete cache bypass on single file corruption
  - Implementation: Add error boundaries and circuit breakers
  
- **C3**: Process Coordination Configuration Error
  - Owner: Both Architects
  - Impact: No backend connectivity
  - Implementation: Standardize port configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è High (Week 2)
- **H1**: WebSocket Connection Resource Exhaustion
  - Owner: Dr. Sarah Chen
  - Impact: Memory exhaustion from accumulated connections
  - Implementation: Add connection limits and cleanup timeouts
  
- **H2**: IPC Error Boundary Missing
  - Owner: Alex Novak
  - Impact: Unhandled promise rejections crash renderer
  - Implementation: Add defensive error handling
  
- **H3**: Database Initialization Race Condition
  - Owner: Dr. Sarah Chen
  - Impact: 500 errors on first requests
  - Implementation: Add proper startup sequencing

### üìä Medium (Week 3)
- **M1**: Angular Material Bundle Optimization
  - Owner: Alex Novak
  - Impact: Large bundle size
  - Implementation: Tree-shaking and lazy loading
  
- **M2**: Cache Architecture Consolidation
  - Owner: Dr. Sarah Chen
  - Impact: Complex cache management
  - Implementation: Unified cache interface

## Implementation Protocol

### Before Each Fix
```bash
# Validate current state
./validate-session-start.sh

# Create fix branch
git checkout -b fix/[issue-id]-description
```

### After Each Fix
```bash
# Run validation
./validate-task-completion.sh

# Update documentation
# Update CLAUDE.md with fix status
# Update this plan with completion date
```

### Testing Requirements
Each fix must include:
1. Unit tests for the specific fix
2. Integration test for affected systems
3. Failure mode test to verify fix prevents issue
4. Performance test to ensure no regression

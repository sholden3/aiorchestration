# Hallucination Detection Integration Round Table Decision

**Decision Date**: 2025-01-28  
**Participants**: Dr. Sarah Chen, Alex Novak, Dr. Elena Vasquez (new), Sam Martinez, David Kim  
**Status**: Approved - Phased Implementation  
**Type**: Feature Addition with New Persona  
**Impact**: Medium - Adds content validation capabilities  

## Context and Problem Statement

During governance implementation, we identified the need for detecting AI-generated hallucinations in code comments, documentation, and specifications. Two approaches were proposed:
1. Simple pattern-based detection (~100 lines)
2. Comprehensive detection system (~800 lines)

**Critical Issue**: Need to balance detection accuracy with performance impact on git hooks.

## Round Table Discussion Summary

### Dr. Sarah Chen (Backend Architecture)
- **Position**: Start simple, evolve based on usage
- **Concern**: Performance impact on pre-commit hooks
- **Recommendation**: Implement basic detection first, measure false positive rates

### Alex Novak (Frontend/Integration)  
- **Position**: Prioritize developer experience
- **Concern**: Integration complexity and debugging at 3 AM
- **Question**: Do we need a new persona or extend existing ones?

### Dr. Elena Vasquez (Proposed Fact-Checking Specialist)
- **Position**: Specialized persona justified for this domain
- **Key Feature**: Veto power for verified misinformation
- **Approach**: Plugin architecture for future extensibility

### Sam Martinez (Testing)
- **Requirement**: Hook execution must stay under 2 seconds
- **Metrics**: False positive rate targets:
  - Development: <10%
  - Production: <5%
  - Critical content: <1%

### David Kim (Code Quality)
- **Position**: Configuration over code
- **Architecture**: Plugin-based for future ML integration
- **Requirement**: YAML-based pattern configuration

## Decision

### Phased Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1.5b: Hallucination Detection (Immediate - 3 days)
```yaml
Duration: 3 days
Goal: Basic pattern-based detection
Deliverables:
  - Dr. Elena Vasquez persona configuration
  - Basic hallucination detector in SmartRules
  - YAML pattern configuration
  - Initial test suite
Success Criteria:
  - Detection of obvious fabrications
  - <500ms performance impact
  - <10% false positive rate
```

#### Phase 2.5: Enhanced Detection (Week 2)
```yaml
Duration: 1 week
Goal: Improved accuracy and suggestions
Deliverables:
  - Confidence scoring system
  - Correction suggestions
  - CLI fact-checking tool
  - Performance monitoring
Success Criteria:
  - <5% false positive rate
  - Actionable correction suggestions
  - Performance benchmarks established
```

#### Phase 3.5: Advanced Detection (Month 2 - If Needed)
```yaml
Duration: 2 weeks
Goal: ML-based detection (conditional)
Trigger: Only if Phase 2.5 shows >5% false negatives
Deliverables:
  - ML model integration
  - Advanced pattern library
  - Context-aware detection
```

## Technical Design

### Architecture Overview
```python
# Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
class HallucinationDetectorPlugin:
    @abstractmethod
    def detect(self, content: str) -> List[Finding]:
        pass

class BasicPatternDetector(HallucinationDetectorPlugin):
    """Phase 1.5b implementation"""
    pass

class AdvancedMLDetector(HallucinationDetectorPlugin):
    """Future Phase 3.5 implementation"""
    pass
```

### Integration Points
1. **SmartRules**: Add `check_for_hallucinations()` method
2. **Pre-commit Hook**: Call detector for documentation files
3. **Persona System**: Add Dr. Elena Vasquez with veto power
4. **Configuration**: YAML-based pattern management

### Pattern Configuration Structure
```yaml
# governance-config/hallucination-patterns.yml
version: "1.0"
patterns:
  critical:  # Always block
    - fabricated_statistics
    - fake_urls
    - impossible_versions
  warning:   # Flag for review
    - vague_attributions
    - unsourced_claims
  info:      # Log only
    - temporal_inconsistencies
```

## Implementation Assignments

| Task | Owner | Deadline |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basic detector class | Sarah Chen | Day 1 |
| SmartRules integration | Alex Novak | Day 2 |
| Pattern configuration | Elena Vasquez | Day 1 |
| Test suite | Sam Martinez | Day 3 |
| Performance benchmarks | David Kim | Day 3 |

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1.5b Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic detection operational
- [ ] False positive rate <10%
- [ ] Performance impact <500ms
- [ ] 50+ test cases passing

### Phase 2.5 Success Criteria
- [ ] False positive rate <5%
- [ ] Correction suggestions helpful (user survey)
- [ ] CLI tool adopted by team
- [ ] No performance degradation

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Performance Impact**: Mitigated by pattern limits and file size caps
2. **False Positives**: Mitigated by phased rollout and sensitivity settings
3. **Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by plugin architecture
4. **Adoption Resistance**: Mitigated by optional activation initially

### Rollback Plan
1. Feature flag to disable detection
2. Revert to previous SmartRules version
3. Remove Elena Vasquez from persona rotation
4. Recovery time: <5 minutes

## Approval and Sign-off

### Architect Approvals

**Dr. Sarah Chen** ✅
"Phased approach addresses performance concerns while providing value. The plugin architecture ensures we can evolve without disruption."

**Alex Novak** ✅  
"Simple initial implementation maintains debuggability. Integration approach preserves existing workflows."

### Specialist Approvals

**Dr. Elena Vasquez** ✅
"My role is clearly defined with appropriate veto power for critical misinformation."

**Sam Martinez** ✅
"Testing approach is sound with clear metrics and benchmarks."

**David Kim** ✅
"Configuration-driven approach maintains code quality standards."

## Decision Outcome

**APPROVED** - Implement Phase 1.5b immediately with basic pattern detection.

### Rationale
1. **Immediate Value**: Basic detection catches obvious hallucinations
2. **Low Risk**: Simple implementation with easy rollback
3. **Future Proof**: Plugin architecture allows enhancement
4. **Performance Safe**: Minimal impact on developer workflow

### Next Steps
1. Create basic hallucination detector (Sarah)
2. Add Dr. Elena Vasquez persona config (Elena)
3. Integrate with SmartRules (Alex)
4. Create test fixtures (Sam)
5. Benchmark performance (David)

# Phase 2.5 - Day 2 Afternoon Integration Testing Session

**Date**: 2025-01-27 (Day 2 Afternoon)  
**Time**: 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM  
**Session Type**: Cross-System Integration Testing  
**Lead**: Sam Martinez v3.2.0  
**Support**: Alex Novak v3.0 & Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2  
**Framework**: Full Governance Orchestration

## üí¨ AFTERNOON KICKOFF ROUNDTABLE

### Sam Martinez v3.2.0 - Testing Lead
**Opening Statement**: "Morning's unit tests were excellent. Now we need to prove these components work together. Integration testing will reveal timing issues, coordination problems, and assumption violations we haven't discovered yet."

**Integration Test Strategy**:
1. **Vertical Slices**: Test complete user journeys
2. **Boundary Testing**: Focus on component handoffs
3. **Error Propagation**: Ensure failures are handled across layers
4. **Performance Under Load**: Combined component stress testing
5. **Correlation Tracking**: Verify debugging capability end-to-end

### Alex Novak v3.0 - Frontend Integration
**Key Integration Points**:
"The IPC service now has security boundaries, but how does it coordinate with the terminal service? We need to test:
1. IPC ‚Üí Terminal command execution
2. Terminal output ‚Üí IPC ‚Üí Frontend display
3. Error handling across IPC boundary
4. Correlation IDs through the entire flow"

**Assumption to Test**: "IPC security doesn't break existing terminal functionality"

### Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2 - Backend Integration
**Critical Paths to Validate**:
"The WebSocket manager now has resource limits, but how does it interact with other services?
1. Cache ‚Üí WebSocket broadcast
2. Multiple clients with resource limits
3. Backpressure impact on frontend
4. Database ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí WebSocket flow"

**Three Questions for Integration**:
1. **What breaks first under combined load?**
2. **How do we detect cascade failures?**
3. **What's our recovery strategy?**

## üéØ INTEGRATION TEST PLAN

### Test Suite 1: IPC ‚Üî Terminal Integration
**Owner**: Alex Novak & Sam Martinez  
**Focus**: Security boundaries don't break functionality

**Test Cases**:
1. Terminal command execution through secured IPC
2. Dynamic channel creation for terminal output
3. Large output handling with size limits
4. Error propagation from terminal to frontend
5. Cleanup verification on terminal close

### Test Suite 2: IPC ‚Üî WebSocket ‚Üî Cache Integration
**Owner**: Dr. Sarah Chen & Sam Martinez  
**Focus**: Full data flow with resource limits

**Test Cases**:
1. Cache update ‚Üí WebSocket broadcast ‚Üí IPC notification
2. Multiple client subscriptions under resource limits
3. Backpressure handling when approaching limits
4. Cache miss ‚Üí Backend fetch ‚Üí Update flow
5. Connection cleanup impact on cache subscriptions

### Test Suite 3: Error Cascade Testing
**Owner**: All Personas  
**Focus**: Failures don't cascade catastrophically

**Test Cases**:
1. Backend down ‚Üí Frontend graceful degradation
2. WebSocket exhaustion ‚Üí IPC error handling
3. Cache failure ‚Üí Service resilience
4. Terminal crash ‚Üí Cleanup verification
5. Correlation ID preservation through errors

### Test Suite 4: Performance Integration
**Owner**: Sam Martinez & Riley Thompson  
**Focus**: Combined load testing

**Test Cases**:
1. 50 concurrent IPC requests + 50 WebSocket connections
2. Large cache operations during terminal activity
3. Memory usage under combined load
4. CPU usage with all services active
5. Cleanup efficiency under stress

## üîÑ INTEGRATION ASSUMPTIONS TO VALIDATE

### Collective Assumptions Review

**Sam**: "I assume our mocked services accurately represent production behavior, but integration might reveal differences."

**Alex**: "IPC security was tested in isolation, but terminal service integration might reveal edge cases with dynamic channels."

**Sarah**: "WebSocket limits work alone, but with cache broadcast storms, behavior might differ."

**Agreement**: Test with production-like data volumes and patterns.

## üìù INTEGRATION TEST IMPLEMENTATION

### Critical Integration Points Identified

1. **IPC ‚Üí Terminal ‚Üí WebSocket Flow**
   - Command execution request
   - Output streaming through dynamic channels
   - WebSocket broadcast of terminal events
   - Frontend display update

2. **Cache ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí IPC Notification**
   - Cache invalidation event
   - WebSocket broadcast to subscribers
   - IPC notification to frontend
   - UI update trigger

3. **Error Boundary Coordination**
   - Backend error generation
   - WebSocket error transmission
   - IPC error handling
   - Frontend error display

4. **Resource Cleanup Chain**
   - Terminal process termination
   - IPC channel cleanup
   - WebSocket connection close
   - Memory verification

## üö® INTEGRATION RISKS IDENTIFIED

### High Risk Areas

1. **Timing Dependencies**
   - Risk: Async operations might race
   - Mitigation: Add explicit coordination
   - Test: Stress test with delays

2. **Resource Contention**
   - Risk: Services compete for resources
   - Mitigation: Priority queues
   - Test: Saturate all services simultaneously

3. **Cascade Failures**
   - Risk: One service failure kills others
   - Mitigation: Circuit breakers everywhere
   - Test: Systematic failure injection

4. **Memory Accumulation**
   - Risk: Combined services leak memory
   - Mitigation: Aggressive cleanup
   - Test: 1-hour sustained load test

## üí¨ MORNING ORCHESTRATION ROUNDTABLE

### Alex Novak v3.0 - Frontend Architect
**Opening Statement**: "Yesterday we fixed the terminal memory leak. Today we need to secure the IPC boundaries. Every IPC channel is a potential security hole if not properly validated."

**Key Concerns for Day 2**:
1. **IPC Channel Whitelisting**: Not all channels should be allowed
2. **Error Boundaries**: Every IPC call needs defensive handling
3. **Message Size Limits**: Prevent memory exhaustion via IPC
4. **Correlation IDs**: Need tracking across IPC calls for debugging

**Assumption to Validate**: "I assume our IPC whitelist is comprehensive, but we might discover dynamic channels we didn't know about."

### Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2 - Backend Architect
**Opening Statement**: "The WebSocket resource exhaustion (H1) is critical. Without limits, one misbehaving client can take down the entire backend."

**Three Questions for WebSocket Fix**:
1. **What breaks first?** Connection pool exhaustion at ~1000 connections
2. **How do we know?** Memory usage spikes, then OOM killer activates
3. **What's Plan B?** Reject new connections with backpressure signal

**Assumption to Validate**: "I assume 100 concurrent connections is reasonable, but we need to test actual resource usage per connection."

### Sam Martinez v3.2.0 - Testing Specialist
**Testing Strategy for Day 2**:
"We need three types of tests today:
1. **Security Tests**: Try to break IPC validation
2. **Resource Tests**: Exhaust WebSocket connections
3. **Integration Tests**: Verify IPC‚ÜîWebSocket‚ÜîCache flow"

**Critical Test Scenarios**:
- Unauthorized IPC channel access
- Oversized IPC messages
- WebSocket connection flooding
- Concurrent resource limits
- Cross-system message correlation

**Assumption to Validate**: "Tests assume synchronous behavior, but IPC and WebSocket are async - timing will be critical."

### Morgan Hayes v2.0 - Security Specialist
**Security Assessment**: "I need to review both fixes for security implications:
1. **IPC Channels**: Each channel is an attack vector
2. **WebSocket Limits**: DDoS prevention critical
3. **Message Validation**: Prevent injection attacks
4. **Resource Boundaries**: Enforce strict limits"

**Security Requirements**:
- Channel whitelist must be immutable
- Message sanitization required
- Rate limiting per client
- Audit logging for failures

**Assumption to Validate**: "The whitelist pattern matching might have regex vulnerabilities."

### Riley Thompson v1.1 - DevOps Specialist
**Infrastructure Concerns**: "Resource limits need monitoring:
1. **Metrics Required**: Connection count, memory per connection, CPU usage
2. **Alerts Needed**: 80% threshold warnings
3. **Cleanup Automation**: Dead connection reaping
4. **Load Testing**: Verify limits under stress"

**Assumption to Validate**: "Docker containers might have different resource characteristics than bare metal."

### Quinn Roberts v1.1 - Documentation Specialist
**Documentation Requirements for Day 2**:
"Every file touched needs:
1. Complete header with architecture reference
2. Security considerations documented
3. Resource limits explained
4. Hook points identified
5. Assumptions listed"

**Tracking Method**: "I'll maintain a documentation score for each file."

## üîÑ ASSUMPTION VALIDATION DISCUSSION

### Collective Assumption Review

**Alex**: "Let's discuss our collective assumptions before coding."

**Sarah**: "My biggest assumption is that WebSocket connections are lightweight. But with our event handlers, each might consume significant memory."

**Sam**: "I'm assuming our test environment mirrors production, but IPC behavior might differ in Electron's main vs renderer process."

**Morgan**: "Security assumption: We're trusting the IPC channel names are static, but what if they're dynamically generated?"

**Alex**: "Good point. We might need pattern-based whitelisting, not exact matching."

**Riley**: "Infrastructure assumption: We can actually limit resources in the test environment. Some limits only work in production."

**Quinn**: "Documentation assumption: Developers will read the headers. We need to make them concise but complete."

### Consensus Assumptions to Test Today

1. **IPC Channel Patterns**: Static vs dynamic channel names
2. **WebSocket Memory**: Actual memory per connection
3. **Async Timing**: IPC/WebSocket coordination timing
4. **Resource Limits**: Test vs production enforcement
5. **Security Boundaries**: Whitelist effectiveness

## üìã TASK ASSIGNMENTS WITH GOVERNANCE

### Task 1: IPC Service Security Tests
**Lead**: Alex Novak v3.0  
**Support**: Sam Martinez v3.2.0, Morgan Hayes v2.0  
**Validation**: Sarah Chen must review for backend impact  

**Specific Requirements**:
```typescript
// Alex's Requirements
- Channel whitelist with patterns
- Message size validation
- Error boundary implementation
- Correlation ID tracking

// Sam's Test Requirements
- Unauthorized channel tests
- Oversized message tests
- Injection attempt tests
- Timing attack tests

// Morgan's Security Requirements
- Audit logging for failures
- Rate limiting per channel
- Message sanitization
- Immutable whitelist
```

### Task 2: WebSocket Resource Limits (H1)
**Lead**: Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2  
**Support**: Riley Thompson v1.1  
**Validation**: Alex must review for frontend impact  

**Specific Requirements**:
```python
# Sarah's Requirements
- Max 100 concurrent connections
- 5-minute idle timeout
- Memory limit per connection
- Backpressure signaling

# Riley's Monitoring Requirements
- Connection count metrics
- Memory usage tracking
- CPU usage per connection
- Cleanup verification
```

### Task 3: Integration Tests
**Lead**: Sam Martinez v3.2.0  
**Support**: Both Architects  
**Focus**: Cross-system boundaries  

**Test Scenarios**:
```python
# Critical Flows to Test
1. IPC -> Backend API -> Cache -> Response
2. IPC -> WebSocket -> Broadcast -> Frontend
3. Error propagation across boundaries
4. Resource cleanup on disconnect
5. Correlation ID flow through system
```

## üö® CRITICAL DECISION POINTS

### Decision 1: IPC Channel Naming Strategy
**Options Presented**:
1. Exact string matching (simple, rigid)
2. Pattern matching (flexible, complex)
3. Hierarchical namespaces (organized, verbose)

**Alex**: "I prefer patterns - `app:*` for app channels, `system:*` for system"
**Morgan**: "Patterns are risky if not carefully validated"
**Sarah**: "Hierarchical gives us future flexibility"

**DECISION**: Hierarchical with pattern support: `app:feature:action`

### Decision 2: WebSocket Connection Limit
**Options Presented**:
1. 100 connections (conservative)
2. 500 connections (balanced)
3. 1000 connections (aggressive)

**Sarah**: "100 is safe but might be too restrictive"
**Riley**: "Our monitoring can handle 500"
**Alex**: "Frontend typically needs 10-20 max"

**DECISION**: 100 default, configurable via environment variable

### Decision 3: Test Coverage Target for Day 2
**Options Presented**:
1. Focus on critical paths only (faster)
2. Comprehensive security tests (thorough)
3. Balance both (realistic)

**Sam**: "Security tests are crucial given our vulnerabilities"
**Sarah**: "Critical paths ensure system works"
**Alex**: "We need both for confidence"

**DECISION**: Critical paths first, security tests second, stretch for both

# Round Table: Bedrock Phase - Foundation Stabilization
**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Phase Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Risk Level**: HIGH  
**Session Facilitator**: Dr. Sarah Chen  

## üìä Current System State
- Backend: Governance module operational but untested
- Frontend: TypeScript errors resolved, build successful
- Testing: No automated tests for new governance code
- Documentation: Basic structure in place

---

## üéØ Phase Objective
Establish rock-solid foundation for all future development by completing core infrastructure stabilization, ensuring every component has proper error handling, monitoring, and testing.

## üë• Round Table Attendees

### Dr. Sarah Chen - Backend Systems Architect
**Position**: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS  
**Statement**: "The governance module is structurally sound but lacks production hardening. We need comprehensive error boundaries and circuit breakers before moving forward."

**Requirements**:
1. Add retry logic with exponential backoff to all governance validators
2. Implement health check endpoints for each governance component
3. Add structured logging with correlation IDs
4. Create fallback mechanisms for governance failures

**Concerns**:
- No current monitoring for governance decisions
- Missing rate limiting on session creation
- Potential memory leak in session cleanup task

### Alex Novak - Frontend Integration Architect  
**Position**: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS  
**Statement**: "Frontend builds are green, but we're flying blind without IPC error handling. The terminal component needs defensive boundaries."

**Requirements**:
1. Add IPC connection retry logic
2. Implement graceful degradation for backend failures
3. Add session recovery mechanisms
4. Create user-facing error messages

**Concerns**:
- No timeout handling for IPC calls
- Missing reconnection logic for dropped sessions
- Terminal component lacks error boundaries

### Maya Patel - QA & Testing Lead
**Position**: REQUEST MODIFICATIONS  
**Statement**: "Zero test coverage on critical new code is unacceptable. We need at least 80% coverage before claiming stability."

**Requirements**:
1. Unit tests for all governance modules (100% coverage)
2. Integration tests for governance-FastAPI interaction
3. Component tests for terminal with mocked IPC
4. E2E test for session lifecycle

**Concerns**:
- No tests for failure scenarios
- Missing performance benchmarks
- No regression test suite

### Marcus Johnson - DevOps Engineer
**Position**: APPROVE  
**Statement**: "Infrastructure can support the changes, but we need better observability."

**Requirements**:
1. Add Prometheus metrics for governance decisions
2. Configure log aggregation for governance events
3. Set up alerts for critical failures
4. Document runbook for common issues

**Concerns**:
- No current APM instrumentation
- Missing deployment health checks
- No canary deployment strategy

### Sam Rivera - Database Architect
**Position**: APPROVE  
**Statement**: "Session storage is memory-only, which is acceptable for now but needs persistence roadmap."

**Requirements**:
1. Define session persistence strategy
2. Plan for session migration to Redis
3. Document data retention policies
4. Create session analytics schema

**Concerns**:
- Session data lost on restart
- No session history tracking
- Missing audit trail

### Jordan Kim - UI/UX Designer
**Position**: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS  
**Statement**: "Terminal UX is functional but lacks polish. Error states need user-friendly messaging."

**Requirements**:
1. Design error state UI for terminal
2. Add loading indicators for session creation
3. Create tooltips for terminal controls
4. Implement keyboard shortcuts

**Concerns**:
- No visual feedback for connection status
- Missing accessibility attributes
- Unclear error messages

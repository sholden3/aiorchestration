@fileoverview API package for governance system - RESTful endpoints for external integration
@author Dr. Sarah Chen v1.0 - 2025-08-29
@architecture Backend - REST API layer
@responsibility Expose governance functionality via HTTP/REST endpoints
@dependencies FastAPI, core governance modules
@integration_points HTTP clients, CI/CD systems, monitoring dashboards
@testing_strategy API endpoint tests, integration tests, contract tests
@governance API calls are themselves governed and validated

Business Logic Summary:
- Expose governance evaluation endpoints
- Provide metrics and monitoring APIs
- Enable remote governance validation
- Support webhook integrations
- Manage API authentication and rate limiting

Architecture Integration:
- Built on FastAPI framework
- Uses core governance engine
- Integrates with monitoring systems
- Provides webhook callbacks
- Supports async operations

Sarah's Framework Check:
- What breaks first: Rate limiting under high load
- How we know: 429 errors and request queue buildup
- Plan B: Circuit breaker and graceful degradation

Package Purpose:
Future REST API implementation for:
1. Remote governance validation
2. Metrics and monitoring endpoints
3. Webhook integrations
4. Dashboard data APIs
5. Configuration management endpoints

Note: This package is planned for future implementation.
Currently, governance is accessed directly via Python imports.

@architecture Backend - Event system
@responsibility Manage governance events and notifications
@dependencies asyncio, event emitters
@integration_points Monitoring, webhooks, audit system

Business Logic Summary:
- Emit governance events
- Handle event subscriptions
- Process event chains
- Manage event priorities
- Track event metrics

Architecture Integration:
- Async event system
- Observer pattern
- Event sourcing
- Webhook triggers
- Audit integration

Sarah's Framework Check:
- What breaks first: Event queue overflow
- How we know: Memory usage spike, dropped events
- Plan B: Event sampling and prioritization

Event Types:
- ValidationStarted
- ValidationCompleted
- RuleViolation
- PersonaConsulted
- DecisionMade
- AuditLogged

Note: Event system planned for async operations.
Currently using synchronous logging.

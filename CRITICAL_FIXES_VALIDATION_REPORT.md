## Comprehensive System Validation

### Sarah's Three Questions Framework

**1. What breaks first?**
- C1: IPC listeners accumulate → memory exhaustion
- C2: Disk I/O fails → cache operations fail
- C3: Port mismatch → no backend connectivity

**Answer**: All identified failure points now protected with defensive patterns

**2. How do we know?**
- Comprehensive metrics tracking all failure scenarios
- Enhanced logging with correlation IDs
- Circuit breaker state monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

**Answer**: Full observability implemented across all systems

**3. What's Plan B?**
- C1: Emergency cleanup via TerminalManagerService
- C2: Circuit breaker bypasses cache, serves from source
- C3: Health checks prevent cascading failures

**Answer**: Graceful degradation paths implemented for all scenarios

### Alex's 3 AM Test

**Can this be debugged at 3 AM without calling anyone?**
- ✅ Yes - Clear error messages with context
- ✅ Yes - Correlation IDs link related events
- ✅ Yes - Comprehensive logging at all integration points

**Are all integration points documented?**
- ✅ Yes - IPC boundaries documented
- ✅ Yes - Cache layer interfaces documented
- ✅ Yes - Process coordination documented

**Is cleanup/resource management verified?**
- ✅ Yes - Memory leaks eliminated
- ✅ Yes - IPC listeners properly managed
- ✅ Yes - Cache resources bounded

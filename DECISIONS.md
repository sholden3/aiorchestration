## 🧪 TESTING & QUALITY

### 2025-01-27 - All Specialists - Phase 2.5 Implementation Pivot

**Invoked By**: User with full specialist roundtable
**Context**: Phase 2 revealed extensive documentation but minimal implementation. User identified critical need to validate frameworks through actual code.

**Critical User Insight**: 
> "We can wax poetic all day long, but without actual implementation, we may have introduced an error in our logic that we have to retroactively add back in."

**Unanimous Decision (6-0 vote)**:
1. **Pivot to Implementation Immediately**: Stop pure documentation, start coding with documentation
2. **80% Test Coverage Target**: Not perfection, but confidence in foundation
3. **Assumption Discovery Process**: Document every assumption that proves wrong
4. **Hook Point Mapping**: Mark every place governance will integrate

**Specialist Consensus Quotes**:
- Sam Martinez: "We're at ZERO PERCENT coverage!"
- Alex Novak: "Documentation without implementation is fiction"
- Sarah Chen: "What breaks first? We'll find out through implementation"
- Riley Thompson: "Infrastructure should exist before planning castles"
- Avery Chen: "Mock boundaries first, real AI after governance"
- Quinn Roberts: "Documentation must serve code, not vice versa"

**Binding Constraints**:
- No new features until 80% test coverage achieved
- Every test must document assumptions discovered
- All code must meet documentation standards from Day 1
- AI remains mocked until governance framework proven
- Defensive patterns required in all services

**Technical Approach**:
1. Week 1: Critical service tests and CI/CD pipeline
2. Week 2: Complete coverage and assumption documentation
3. Week 3: Framework validation and governance preparation

**Documentation Created**:
- [x] phase-2.5-implementation-plan.md - Detailed execution plan
- [x] assumption-discovery-log.md - Track all discoveries
- [ ] Hook integration map - In progress during implementation

**Integration Impact**:
- **Frontend**: All services need tests and defensive patterns
- **Backend**: Circuit breakers and resource limits required
- **Testing**: Real tests replace documentation
- **CI/CD**: Pipeline must be operational Week 1
- **Governance**: Hook points mapped during implementation

**Follow-up Required**:
- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage - Sam Martinez - Week 2
- [ ] Operational CI/CD pipeline - Riley Thompson - Week 1 Day 1
- [ ] Fix all critical issues (C1-C3) - Alex Novak - Week 1
- [ ] Document all assumptions - Quinn Roberts - Continuous
- [ ] Map governance hooks - Avery Chen - Continuous

### 2025-09-02 - Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2 - Database Resilience Pattern

**Invoked By**: Steven Holden  
**Context**: Database connection failures causing cascading system issues and poor user experience  

**Decisions Made**:
1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation**:
   - Failure threshold: 3 attempts before opening circuit
   - Recovery timeout: 30 seconds before attempting half-open state
   - State tracking: CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN cycle
2. **Database Service Enhancement**:
   - Integrated circuit breaker for all connection attempts
   - Connection status endpoint for monitoring
   - Graceful fallback to mock data when circuit is open
3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduced UI polling from 5s to 30s (WebSocket provides real-time updates)
   - Prevented repeated connection attempts during outages

**Binding Constraints**:
- Circuit breaker must be used for all external service calls
- Connection status must be exposed via /database/status endpoint
- Fallback behavior must maintain user experience

**Documentation Created**:
- [x] Circuit breaker module with full documentation
- [x] Enhanced database service with status tracking
- [x] API endpoint documentation

**Integration Impact**:
- Backend: All database calls now protected by circuit breaker
- Frontend: Reduced polling frequency for better performance
- Monitoring: New endpoint for database health checks

**Follow-up Required**:
- [ ] Add unit tests for circuit breaker - Sam Martinez - Priority High
- [ ] Add integration tests for database service - Dr. Jamie Rodriguez - Priority High
- [ ] Monitor production metrics after deployment - Taylor Williams

## ⚠️ ENFORCEMENT RULES

1. **No Implementation Without Documentation**: Code cannot be merged if it implements a specialist decision without corresponding entry here
2. **Specialist Authority**: Only the specialist who made a decision can override it
3. **Core Persona Mediation**: Conflicts between specialists must be mediated by Alex & Sarah
4. **Weekly Review**: Unreviewed decisions older than 1 week trigger alerts

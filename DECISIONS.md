### DEC-2025-012: Data-Driven Persona System ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-01-05  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** Approved & Implemented  

**Decision:** Implement data-driven persona management system using YAML configuration instead of hardcoded persona logic

**Context:** The MCP server needs to consult various personas for domain expertise. Hardcoding persona logic would be inflexible and difficult to maintain. A data-driven approach allows dynamic configuration and easier updates.

**Implementation:**
- Created `libs/governance/personas.yaml` with comprehensive persona definitions
- Implemented `PersonaManager` class to load and manage personas dynamically
- Integrated data-driven personas into MCP server

**Benefits:**
1. **Flexibility**: Personas can be added/modified without code changes
2. **Maintainability**: All persona data in single YAML file
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new trigger patterns and expertise areas
4. **Testability**: Can use test configurations for unit tests

**Configuration Structure:**
- Core personas (always present): Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen
- Specialist personas (on-demand): 10 specialists with specific domains
- Automatic invocation rules based on patterns
- Crisis experience and decision frameworks per persona

## Recent Decisions (Last 30 Days)

### DEC-2025-011: MCP Integration Architecture ðŸ”µ
**Date:** 2025-01-05  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Specialist Consultations:** Jordan Lee (Real-time Systems), Morgan Hayes (Security)  
**Status:** Approved & Pending  

**Decision:** Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for proactive governance consultation, transforming from reactive validation to intelligent assistance

**Context:** Current governance system only validates after actions are taken. Research shows MCP can enable Claude Code to consult governance during reasoning, dramatically improving developer experience and reducing errors.

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
# Core MCP Server Structure
class GovernanceMCPServer:
    port = discover_backend_port("mcp-governance")  # Dynamic allocation
    governance = RuntimeGovernanceSystem()          # Existing system
    personas = PersonaManager()                     # Existing personas
    database = DatabaseManager()                    # Existing DB
    cache = IntelligentCache()                      # <100ms responses
```

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Keep reactive validation only**
   - Pros: Simpler, already working
   - Cons: Poor developer experience, errors caught late
2. **Build custom protocol**
   - Pros: Tailored to our needs
   - Cons: Reinventing wheel, no Claude Code support
3. **MCP with phased implementation** (Selected)
   - Pros: Industry standard, Claude Code native support, incremental risk
   - Cons: 4-week implementation timeline

**Implementation Approach:**
- 20 phases over 4 weeks, each phase â‰¤1 day
- Reuse existing infrastructure (port discovery, DB, cache)
- Data-driven configuration via YAML
- Full test coverage required per phase
- No shortcuts in bug fixes

**Success Criteria:**
- <100ms response time for cached queries
- >85% cache hit rate
- 99.9% availability
- Zero breaking changes to existing system

### DEC-2025-010: Emergency Dependency Recovery ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Infrastructure Review:** Riley Thompson  
**Status:** Approved & Implemented  

**Decision:** Execute systematic recovery of missing backend infrastructure to restore application functionality

**Context:** Application is completely non-functional due to backend import errors (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'). Analysis revealed missing Python package structure and misplaced configuration files from overzealous cleanup.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Complete rebuild from scratch**
   - Pros: Clean implementation
   - Cons: Time-consuming (days), loss of existing work
2. **Git revert to earlier state**  
   - Pros: Quick restoration
   - Cons: Would lose recent documentation validation work
3. **Selective recovery with validation** (Selected)
   - Pros: Preserves recent work, systematic approach, reversible
   - Cons: Requires careful execution, 2-4 hour timeline

**Implementation Plan:**
- Phase 1: Fix Python package structure (30 min)
- Phase 2: Recover frontend assets (15 min)
- Phase 3: Restore database models (45 min)
- Phase 4: Create startup scripts (30 min)
- Phase 5: Validation & testing (45 min)

**Governance Compliance:**
- âœ… Full backup created: `.archive/20250903_223224_dependency_recovery/`
- âœ… Manifest file created with rollback procedure
- âœ… Phased approach with validation gates
- âœ… Documentation updated before execution
- âœ… All phases validated and passed (30/30 checks)
- âœ… Recovery validation report: 100% success rate

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Backup created with manifest
- Each phase independently reversible
- Validation script for success criteria
- Clear rollback procedure documented

**Implementation Notes:**
- Phase 1: Created Python package structure with proper `__init__.py` files
- Phase 2: Recovered `check-pty.js` and created assets directories
- Phase 3: Recovered database models, schema, and initialization scripts from RecoveryProject
- Phase 4: Determined startup scripts unnecessary - Electron backend-manager handles everything
- Phase 5: All 30 validation checks passed successfully

**Key Discoveries:**
- Backend uses dynamic port discovery through Electron backend-manager.js
- No shell scripts needed - npm scripts and Electron handle startup
- Database uses both SQLAlchemy models AND raw asyncpg for different purposes
- Frontend more complete than RecoveryProject (58 vs 2 TypeScript files)

## DEC-2025-011: Validation System Architecture Consolidation

**Decision Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Status:** âœ… Implemented  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Impact:** High  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen, Isabella Martinez (Doc Lead)

### Decision
Decompose redundant validation documentation files into existing structure rather than creating new directories.

### Rationale
- **Problem:** Three validation-related files existed at root level without clear organization
- **Analysis:** Files contained duplicated and obsolete information already implemented in validators
- **Principle:** "Eat our own dog food" - our documentation must follow our own standards

### Implementation
1. **documentation_formats.md** â†’ Decomposed into:
   - Validation rules integrated into `.docs-metadata/code-formats.yaml`
   - Template examples already exist in `.docs-metadata/format-templates/`
   - File deleted after integration

2. **docs_validation_setup.md** â†’ Integrated into:
   - Setup instructions moved to `governance/hooks/README.md`
   - Cross-references added to `governance/README.md`

3. **complete_validation_system.md** â†’ Recognized as obsolete:
   - Implementation already exists in `governance/validators/`
   - Tests already exist in `tests/unit/governance/`
   - File marked for deletion

### Outcome
- âœ… Root directory cleaned
- âœ… Information properly organized
- âœ… No new directories created
- âœ… Existing structure strengthened
- âœ… Documentation discoverable where developers expect it

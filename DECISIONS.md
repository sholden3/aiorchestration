## Recent Decisions (Last 30 Days)

### DEC-2025-015: Centralized Configuration Management ðŸŸ¡
**Date:** 2025-01-09  
**Decision Makers:** Dr. Sarah Chen, Alex Novak  
**Status:** Approved & In Progress  

**Decision:** Consolidate 50+ scattered configuration files into centralized config/ hierarchy

**Context:** Configuration audit revealed severe configuration scatter:
- 50+ configuration files across 15+ locations
- 5 different formats (YAML, JSON, INI, JS, PY)
- 8 duplicate configurations
- No single source of truth
- No configuration documentation

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Keep current structure**: Continue with scattered configs (rejected - maintainability nightmare)
2. **Move to environment variables only**: All config in .env (rejected - poor discoverability)
3. **Database configuration**: Store in database (rejected - bootstrap problem)
4. **Centralized hierarchy**: Create config/ directory with clear structure (CHOSEN)

**Rationale:**
- Single source of truth for all configurations
- Clear hierarchy improves discoverability
- Standardized formats (YAML for human-readable, JSON Schema for validation)
- Easier deployment and environment management
- Reduced configuration drift risk

**Implementation Plan:**
```
config/
|-- README.md                    # Configuration guide
|-- base/                       # Base configurations
|-- governance/                 # Governance rules
|-- backend/                    # Backend configs
|-- frontend/                   # Frontend configs
|-- deployment/                 # Deployment configs
+-- schemas/                    # Validation schemas
```

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Create comprehensive backups
2. Migrate governance configs first (lowest risk)
3. Consolidate backend configurations
4. Update all import references
5. Validate all environments
6. Document configuration strategy

**Success Criteria:**
- Configuration files: 50+ â†’ ~20 (60% reduction)
- Duplicate configs: 8 â†’ 0 (100% elimination)
- Format types: 5 â†’ 2 (YAML + JSON Schema)
- Documentation: 0% â†’ 100% coverage
- All tests passing after migration

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Incremental migration by component
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Automated rollback scripts
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### DEC-2025-014: Structural Debt Remediation Phase ðŸŸ¡
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen, Alexandra Voss  
**Status:** Approved & In Progress  

**Decision:** Pause MCP implementation to address critical structural debt before it compounds

**Context:** Alexandra Voss's structure-review assessment identified 3 critical structural issues:
1. **H1**: Naming convention inconsistencies causing module resolution failures
2. **H2**: API architectural debt with 47+ root modules violating SRP
3. **H3**: Configuration management scattered across multiple locations

With documentation health at 100%, we have an unprecedented safety net for structural refactoring.

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. **Continue MCP phases**: Risk compounding technical debt
2. **Partial fixes**: Address only critical issues
3. **Complete refactor**: Full system rewrite (too risky)
4. **Incremental remediation**: Fix issues systematically (CHOSEN)

**Rationale:**
- Documentation success (30% â†’ 100%) proves team execution capability
- Perfect documentation provides comprehensive rollback safety net
- Structural issues will worsen with each new MCP phase
- Window of opportunity exists now with stable system

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Week 1**: Naming conventions (Days 1-3) + Configuration consolidation (Days 4-5)
- **Week 2**: API architecture planning and preparation
- **Week 3**: Incremental API restructuring with continuous validation

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero naming convention violations
- Domain-driven API architecture implemented
- Single configuration source of truth
- All tests passing throughout
- Documentation maintained at 100%

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Incremental approach (one issue at a time)
- Continuous validation after each change
- Git history + 100% documentation for rollback
- Dedicated rollback procedures for each change

### DEC-2025-013: Emergency Documentation Remediation ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-01-06  
**Decision Makers:** Alexandra Voss, Emergency Response Team  
**Status:** Approved & Implemented  

**Decision:** Halt all development for emergency documentation remediation

**Context:** Documentation health dropped to critical 30%, with 70% of documentation outdated. This violated governance requirements and blocked developer onboarding.

**Implementation:** 4-day emergency response that achieved:
- Documentation health: 30% â†’ 100%
- Zero broken links (fixed 52)
- Complete component coverage
- Automated validation in pre-commit hooks

**Outcome:** Complete success, exceeded all targets

### DEC-2025-012: Data-Driven Persona System ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-01-05  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** Approved & Implemented  

**Decision:** Implement data-driven persona management system using YAML configuration instead of hardcoded persona logic

**Context:** The MCP server needs to consult various personas for domain expertise. Hardcoding persona logic would be inflexible and difficult to maintain. A data-driven approach allows dynamic configuration and easier updates.

**Implementation:**
- Created `libs/governance/personas.yaml` with comprehensive persona definitions
- Implemented `PersonaManager` class to load and manage personas dynamically
- Integrated data-driven personas into MCP server
- 12 personas defined covering all project domains

**Outcome:** Flexible, maintainable persona system with 100% test coverage

### DEC-2025-011: MCP Server Foundation Architecture ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-01-05  
**Decision Makers:** Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** Approved & Implemented  

**Decision:** Create MCP governance server as a separate service that can be called by Claude Code's hook bridge

**Context:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration requires a governance layer that can intercept and validate Claude Code operations. The architecture needs to be modular and maintainable.

**Implementation:**
- Separate MCP server in `apps/api/mcp/`
- Port discovery integration for dynamic port allocation
- Dual database support (PostgreSQL with SQLite fallback)
- Configuration-driven setup with environment variable substitution

**Outcome:** Foundation completed with 92% test coverage

### DEC-2025-010: Phased Implementation Methodology ðŸŸ¢
**Date:** 2025-01-04  
**Decision Makers:** Steven Holden, Alex Novak, Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** Approved & Active  

**Decision:** Adopt strict phased implementation with daily deliverables

**Context:** Previous ad-hoc development led to incomplete features and technical debt. Need structured approach for MCP integration.

**Implementation:**
- 20 phases over 4 weeks
- Each phase maximum 1 day
- Mandatory testing and documentation
- No shortcuts in bug fixes
- TodoWrite for all task tracking

**Success Metrics:**
- Phase completion rate: Target 100%
- Test coverage: Minimum 85% per phase
- Documentation: Updated with each phase
- Bug resolution: <4 hours from discovery

**Outcome:** Improved delivery predictability and quality

## Architecture Principles

### Core Principles (Binding)
1. **Configuration Over Code** - Everything externally configurable
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Tests before implementation
3. **Documentation as Code** - Docs part of Definition of Done
4. **No Unicode in Code** - ASCII only for compatibility
5. **Incremental Safe Refactoring** - Small, validated changes
6. **No Hardcoded Values** - All values from configuration
7. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple validation layers

### Design Patterns (Recommended)
1. **Repository Pattern** - For data access abstraction
2. **Factory Pattern** - For object creation
3. **Observer Pattern** - For event handling
4. **Strategy Pattern** - For algorithm selection
5. **Circuit Breaker** - For fault tolerance

- ✅ Integration tests

## ❌ REMAINING WORK

### 1. Organization & Integration (6-8 hours)
**Priority: CRITICAL**
- [ ] **File Organization** (1 hour)
  - Move 41 Python files to proper folders
  - Update import statements
  - Test everything still works

- [ ] **Claude CLI Integration** (2 hours)
  - Connect governance to actual Claude commands
  - Create `.claude_rules.md` for auto-injection
  - Test with real Claude operations

- [ ] **Production Scripts** (1 hour)
  - Startup scripts
  - Environment configuration
  - Health checks

### 2. UI Development (2-3 days)
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] **Build New UI Components** (NOT reusing old ClaudeUI)
  - Configuration management interface
  - Persona selection UI
  - Token usage dashboard
  - Real-time monitoring

- [ ] **Connect to Backend API**
  - Wire up governance API endpoints
  - Implement WebSocket for live updates

  - Full terminal emulation (requested)
  - Support for Bash, PowerShell, cmd
  - Session persistence

### 3. Token Optimization Tools (2-3 days)
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] **File Partitioning System**
  - Intelligent file chunking for reduced tokens
  - Quick lookup mechanisms
  - Fallback to native tools

- [ ] **Custom Tool Wrappers**
  - Token-efficient alternatives to native tools
  - Maintain functionality while reducing usage
  - 65% token reduction target

### 4. Monitoring & Analytics (1-2 days)
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**
  - Persona usage percentages
  - AI agent utilization
  - Token consumption metrics

- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**
  - Response times
  - Cache hit rates (target 90%)
  - Error tracking

### 5. Advanced Features (1 week)
**Priority: LOW**
- [ ] **Custom Persona Loading**
  - Upload new personas
  - Pick and choose active personas
  - Persona marketplace?

- [ ] **Voting Mechanism**
  - Implement persona conflict resolution
  - Dashboard for user review
  - Decision history

- [ ] **Rule Creation Interface**
  - Visual rule builder
  - Test rule impacts
  - Rule templates

## Project Timeline

- Day 5: Production deployment

## Immediate Next Steps (Today)

### 1. File Organization (1 hour)
```bash
cd ai-assistant/backend
mkdir -p api config governance personas cache database core integrations tests scripts
# Move files to proper folders
```

### 2. Claude CLI Integration (2 hours)
- Create `.claude_rules.md`
- Hook into Claude commands
- Test governance enforcement

### 3. Basic UI Setup (2 hours)
- Create Angular components
- Connect to governance API
- Test basic flows

## Success Metrics

### Must Have (MVP)
- ✅ Working governance system
- ⏳ Claude CLI integration
- ⏳ Basic UI for configuration
- ⏳ Token reduction (65% target)

### Should Have
- ⏳ Full terminal emulation
- ⏳ Usage analytics dashboard
- ⏳ Persona voting mechanism

### Nice to Have
- ⏳ Custom persona loading
- ⏳ Advanced rule builder
- ⏳ Performance profiling

## Current Blockers

1. **File Organization**: All files in root makes development messy
2. **No Claude CLI Connection**: Governance not actually enforcing on Claude
3. **No UI**: Backend ready but no interface for users

## Architecture Decision

### Recommended: Local Microservices
Even though it's a desktop app, we can use microservices locally:
- **Backend API**: FastAPI on localhost:8001
- **Governance Service**: Separate process
- **Cache Service**: Separate process
- **UI**: Electron app connecting to local services

Benefits:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Can scale individual services
- Easier to maintain and test
- Can add/remove services as needed

### Communication: GraphQL + WebSocket
- **GraphQL**: For structured queries (recommended for local)
- **WebSocket**: For real-time updates
- **gRPC**: For inter-service communication (optional)

## Reference Materials (DO NOT INTEGRATE)
- `cache_optimizer_project/`: Reference for caching patterns
- `ClaudeUI/`: Reference for UI structure
- `UltimateClaude/`: Reference for persona patterns

## Summary

**Project is 70% complete**. Core functionality is built and tested. Remaining work is primarily:
1. Organization and integration (1 day)
2. UI development (2-3 days)
3. Token optimization (2-3 days)

With focused effort, **MVP can be ready in 3-5 days**, full production in **2 weeks**.

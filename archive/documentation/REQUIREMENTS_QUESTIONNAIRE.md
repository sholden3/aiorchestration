- [ ] Product Managers
- [ ] Other: _______________
```
Your Answer: 
```

Software developers looking for a tool to help them develop.

**Question**: What is the expected scale of usage?

- Requests per second (average): ________10_______
- Requests per second (peak): _________20______
- Data volume per day: ______Unknown at this time_________
```
Your Answer: 
```

This tool is for personal use, do to issues of morality having it be a tool used by corporations.

**Question**: What is the business criticality level?
- [ ] Mission-critical (downtime costs > $10k/hour)
- [ ] Business-critical (downtime impacts revenue)
- [ ] Important (downtime impacts productivity)
- [ X] Standard (normal availability expectations)
- [ X] Experimental (proof of concept)
```
Your Answer: 
```

As this is a personal tool, there is no business criticality level for uptime or downtime of the application.

### 2. Multi-Tenancy Requirements
**Question**: Is multi-tenancy required?
- [ ] Yes, required now
- [ ] Yes, required in future (timeline: _______________)
- [ ] No, single tenant only

```
Your Answer: 
```

I decided for mutli-tenancy with the idea that it may help with separating knowledge between ai-agents. But is this really needed?

**If multi-tenancy is required:**

- Data isolation level required:
  - [ ] Complete isolation (separate databases)
  - [ ] Logical isolation (shared database, separate schemas)

```
Your Answer: 
```

As this is just for ai-agents, we can have it be row-level isolation.

- [ ] GDPR (EU data privacy)
- [ ] HIPAA (healthcare data)
- [ ] SOC2 (security compliance)
- [ ] PCI DSS (payment card data)
- [ ] Other: _______________

- [x ] Emily Watson (UX/Frontend specialist)
- [ ] Custom persona 1: _______________
- [ ] Custom persona 2: _______________
- [ ] Custom persona 3: _______________
```
Your Answer: 
```

For the creation of this tool, use all available currently. When the tool is ready, and we can move onto the ability to load new ai personas, we should be able to upload, and pick and choose what is used.

**Question**: How should personas be activated?
- [ ] User manually selects persona
- [ ] System auto-selects based on context
- [ x] Hybrid (auto-suggest, user confirms)
- [ x] Multiple personas collaborate on same task
```
Your Answer: 
```

We need a hybrid system. As well as having multiple personas being able to be used, as well as multiple ai-agents with either a single persona, or multiple assigned to it. We need reporting on these as well, showing percent usage of ai agent and each persona assigned to it.

**Question**: How should persona conflicts be resolved?
- [ ] Priority ranking (specify order): _______________
- [ x] Voting mechanism
- [ x] User decides
- [ ] First responder wins
```
Your Answer: 
```

Need to have a voting mechanism, and then the decision sent to the user via a dashboard in the ui for them to review and choose.

### 6. Token Optimization Targets
**Question**: What are your token usage goals?

  - [ X] Yes, full history
  - [ ] Yes, last N messages (specify N): _______________
  - [ ] Yes, summary only
  - [ ] No
```
Your Answer: 
```

We need to find ways to add tools that will help limit the amount of tokens used, such as clever partitioning of files for quick look ups, tools that can be used to replicate the native tools while reducing token usage, and more. With fallbacks to the native tools if we cannot do it.

### 7. Fallback Strategy
**Question**: What should happen when Claude API is unavailable?
- [ ] Queue requests and retry
- [ ] Use local LLM fallback
- [ ] Return cached responses
- [ x] Notify user and wait
- [ ] Fail immediately
```
Your Answer: 
```

Notify user and wait. Remember we are using claude code.

**Question**: If using local LLM fallback, which model?
- [ ] Llama 2/3
- [ ] Mistral
- [ ] GPT4All
- [ ] Other: _______________
- [ X] Not applicable
```
Your Answer: 
```

This may be implemented later, but not now.

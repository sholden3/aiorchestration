# AUTO-INJECTED SESSION CONTEXT
## AI Orchestration System - Development Environment

Welcome! You are now working on the **AI Orchestration System** that unifies three projects:
- `cache_optimizer_project/` - Backend caching and optimization
- `UltimateClaude/` - AI persona orchestration
- `ClaudeUI/` - Electron/Angular frontend

---

## üö® ACTIVE PROJECT RULES (ENFORCED)

1. **No Silent Assumptions** - All business logic must be explicitly validated
2. **Performance Boundaries** - Operations must complete within: 
   - API calls: <500ms (P95)
   - Cache operations: <10ms (hot), <100ms (cold)
   - Memory usage: <2GB steady state
3. **Cache Invalidation** - Every cache write must define invalidation conditions
4. **Multi-Tenancy Isolation** - No cross-tenant data access ever
5. **AI Error Handling** - Every Claude call needs fallback behavior

---

## üìä CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### Phase Progress
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation Architecture - **PLANNING**
- ‚è≥ Phase 2: Cache System Optimization - **NOT STARTED**
- ‚è≥ Phase 3: AI Integration & Personas - **NOT STARTED**
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: Frontend/PTY Integration - **NOT STARTED**
- ‚è≥ Phase 5: Testing & Validation - **NOT STARTED**
- ‚è≥ Phase 6: Production Hardening - **NOT STARTED**

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
1. **No connection pooling** - Database will crash under load
2. **Mock PTY implementation** - Terminal doesn't actually work
3. **Unverified token savings** - Claims 70-90% but never measured
4. **Memory leaks** - Cache grows unbounded
5. **No Claude integration** - All AI calls are mocked

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS TO VALIDATE

These assumptions are currently UNVALIDATED and could cause system failure:

1. **Database Response Times**: SQLite completes queries <50ms (95th percentile)
2. **Memory Usage**: App stays under 2GB during normal operation
3. **Claude API**: 99% uptime with <30 second response time
4. **Token Savings**: Cache reduces tokens by 40-60%
5. **PTY Stability**: Terminal sessions stable for 8+ hours on Windows
6. **Cache Hit Rate**: 85% for hot cache operations

---

## üîß DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOLS

### Before Making Changes
1. Check `FILE_MAPPING_INDEX.md` for file locations and dependencies
2. Review `BUSINESS_RULES_ASSUMPTIONS.md` for constraints
3. Validate assumptions that could affect your changes

### When Implementing
1. Follow the phase plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
2. Add tests according to `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`
3. Consider improvements from `DESIGN_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### After Implementation
1. Run all relevant tests
2. Update metrics and validate assumptions
3. Document any new assumptions or rules

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Week 1)

Based on the three-persona analysis, these need immediate attention:

1. **[CRITICAL]** Implement database connection pooling
   - File: `src/database/database_manager.py`
   - Risk: System will crash under any real load
   
2. **[CRITICAL]** Add memory limits to cache
   - File: `src/cache/dual_cache_production.py`
   - Risk: Out of memory errors within hours

3. **[HIGH]** Replace mock PTY with real implementation
   - File: `ClaudeUI/electron-main.js`
   - Risk: Core functionality doesn't work

4. **[HIGH]** Implement real Claude API integration
   - File: `src/claude_enhanced_integration.py`
   - Risk: No actual AI functionality

5. **[MEDIUM]** Remove unused Angular Material modules
   - File: `ClaudeUI/src/app/app.module.ts`
   - Risk: 8MB bundle size slows everything

---

## üìä CURRENT METRICS (BASELINE)

```
Performance Metrics:
- Response Time (P95): Unknown (not measured)
- Memory Usage: Growing unbounded
- Cache Hit Rate: Unknown (claims 85% unverified)
- Token Savings: Claimed 70-90% (unverified)
- Bundle Size: 8MB (target: 2MB)
- Error Rate: Unknown (no monitoring)

Code Quality:
- Test Coverage: ~30% (target: 90%)
- Type Safety: Partial (many any types)
- Documentation: Sparse
- Technical Debt: High

System Health:
- Database Connections: No pooling (will exhaust)
- Memory Leaks: Confirmed in cache
- Error Recovery: None
- Monitoring: None
```

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

You're successful when:
1. ‚úÖ All tests pass (90% coverage)
2. ‚úÖ Performance meets targets (<500ms P95)
3. ‚úÖ Memory stays under 2GB
4. ‚úÖ Cache hit rate >85% (measured, not claimed)
5. ‚úÖ Real PTY and Claude integration working
6. ‚úÖ No silent failures or unvalidated assumptions

---

## üí° TIPS FOR THIS SESSION

1. **Use the File Mapping** - Don't waste time searching for files
2. **Check Assumptions** - Many current assumptions are wrong
3. **Test Everything** - The existing code has hidden bugs
4. **Measure, Don't Assume** - Verify all performance claims
5. **Simple > Complex** - The 3-tier cache should be 2-tier

## üîó RELATED DOCUMENTATION

All documentation is in the project root:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Detailed phase plan
- `FILE_MAPPING_INDEX.md` - Complete file navigation

## ü§ù COLLABORATION NOTES

The three personas (Sarah, Marcus, Emily) have identified these integration points:
- Cache ‚Üí UI: Performance metrics need dashboard
- AI ‚Üí Backend: Token optimization requires cache integration  
- Frontend ‚Üí Backend: WebSocket needed for real-time updates

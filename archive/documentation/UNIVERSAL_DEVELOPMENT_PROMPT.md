# Universal Development Prompt Template

## Core Requirements for Every Task

**YOUR INSTRUCTIONS GO HERE:** Need to review the following documents:

UI_REFERENCE.md
PTY_REFERENCE.md

Look at the following project as well for a guide:

C:\Users\wesho\Desktop\WorkProjects\ClaudeCodeEnhancements\ClaudeResearchAndDevelopment\ClaudeUI

---

## MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### 1. Pre-Implementation Validation
- [ ] Check all existing tests are passing: `python -m pytest -v`
- [ ] Search for existing implementations: `grep -rn "feature_name" --include="*.py"`
- [ ] Verify no TODO/FIXME in affected files: `grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME" affected_file.py`
- [ ] Document current state with evidence (test output, file contents)

### 2. AI Persona Orchestration & Cross-Validation
Every implementation MUST be validated by all three personas:

**Dr. Sarah Chen (AI Integration):**
- Validate all AI/API integrations are properly implemented
- Check token usage optimization
- Verify prompt engineering best practices
- Ensure proper error handling for API failures

**Marcus Rodriguez (Systems Performance):**
- Validate database query efficiency
- Check caching implementation
- Verify no N+1 queries or performance bottlenecks
- Ensure proper indexing and optimization

**Emily Watson (UX/Frontend):**
- Validate user experience implications
- Check accessibility requirements
- Verify error messages are user-friendly
- Ensure consistent UI/UX patterns

### 3. Implementation Requirements

**No Magic Variables:**
- [ ] No hardcoded values (localhost, 127.0.0.1, passwords, ports)
- [ ] All configuration from environment variables or config files
- [ ] No magic numbers without named constants

**No Boilerplate Code:**
- [ ] No `pass` statements
- [ ] No `NotImplementedError` placeholders
- [ ] No empty functions or TODO implementations
- [ ] Full implementation or don't implement at all

**Business Logic Documentation:**
```python
# BUSINESS LOGIC: Explain WHY this code exists
# ASSUMPTION: State any assumptions being made
# VALIDATION: How we verify this assumption
```

### 4. Testing Protocol

**Real Tests Only:**
- [ ] Tests must execute real code, not mocks
- [ ] Tests must assert actual behavior
- [ ] Tests must cover success AND failure cases
- [ ] Run ALL tests after EVERY change: `python -m pytest -v`

**Test Categories to Run:**
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest test_file.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

### 5. Step-by-Step Execution

**Todo Management:**
1. Create todos for each subtask before starting
2. Mark todos as "in_progress" when starting work
3. Mark todos as "completed" immediately after finishing
4. Only one todo should be "in_progress" at a time

**Implementation Flow:**
1. State what you're about to do
2. Show the code you're implementing
3. Run tests to verify it works
4. Explain what the code does and its business assumptions

### 6. Interactive Development

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Should I proceed with [specific approach]?"
- "Do you want [option A] or [option B]?"
- "What are the business rules for [feature]?"
- "What should happen when [edge case]?"

**After Each Section:**
- Summarize what was implemented
- State the business assumptions made
- Show test results proving it works
- Ask: "Does this meet your requirements? Should I continue?"

### 7. Post-Implementation Validation

**Every Single Time:**
```bash
# Check for placeholders
grep -rn "pass$\|NotImplemented\|TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" .

# Check for magic variables  
grep -rn "localhost\|127.0.0.1\|hardcoded\|password" --include="*.py" .

# Run ALL tests
python -m pytest -v

# Check test coverage
python -m pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Final Verification:**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No magic variables
- [ ] No placeholder code
- [ ] Business logic documented
- [ ] All three personas validated

## Example Usage

**Do not read this! Keeping at reference**
```
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS GO HERE: Implement a new caching strategy for user sessions

Following the universal prompt requirements:

1. VALIDATION: First, let me check existing tests and search for current caching implementation
2. PERSONAS: I'll validate this with all three personas - Sarah for API impact, Marcus for performance, Emily for UX
3. TODOS: Creating todos for: analyze current cache, design new strategy, implement, test, validate
4. QUESTION: What's the expected session timeout? Should we use Redis or in-memory cache?
5. IMPLEMENTATION: [show code with business logic comments]
6. TESTING: Running all tests to ensure no regression
7. SUMMARY: Implemented two-tier caching with 15-minute hot cache and 1-hour warm cache. Business assumption: users active within 15 minutes need fastest access. All tests passing.

Does this meet your requirements? Should I continue with the next feature?
```
**Below this is prompt**

Please review the pty and ui template and business rules documentation below this. They are separated. Once reviewed, take out of this document, add to their own documents, and update this prompt with references to them. We need to use this to start building out the ui. Please let me know if you understand.

**Prompt ends**

## Remember

- **Evidence-based development only** - no assumptions without proof
- **Test everything** - run tests after every change
- **Document business logic** - explain the WHY, not just the WHAT
- **Ask questions** - when uncertain, ask for clarification
- **Validate thoroughly** - all three personas must approve
- **No shortcuts** - full implementation or nothing

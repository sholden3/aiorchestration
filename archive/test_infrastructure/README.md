### 2025-08-26_test-setup-electron_v1_baseline.ts

**Approved By**: 
- Alex Novak ✓ (Frontend validation complete)
- Dr. Sarah Chen ✓ (Backend implications reviewed)

**Related Issue**: Phase 1 Enhanced Test Implementation - Addressing cross-challenge requirements

**Reason for Replacement**:
1. Original mocking lacked realistic backend resource state simulation
2. No backpressure or resource exhaustion scenarios
3. Missing database maintenance delay simulations (Sarah's 15-second scenario)
4. Insufficient burst load pattern support (Alex's 25 calls in 500ms pattern)
5. No backend state coordination for integration testing

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Original Version (v1)**:
  - Mock response time: Fixed 10ms delay
  - Resource tracking: Basic PTY count only
  - Failure simulation: Simple random failure rate
  - Memory overhead: ~5MB per test suite

- **Replacement Version (v2)**: 
  - Mock response time: Dynamic based on backend load (10-250ms)
  - Resource tracking: CPU, Memory, Connections, Transactions
  - Failure simulation: Resource-based with backpressure signals
  - Memory overhead: ~8MB per test suite (acceptable for enhanced realism)

**Rollback Instructions**:
1. Copy archived file back to `ai-assistant/src/test-setup-electron.ts`
2. Run `npm test` to verify basic functionality
3. Note: Some enhanced tests may fail with v1 mocks (expected)

**Dependencies**:
- Used by all Angular component tests via test-setup.ts
- IPC Error Boundary tests depend on failure simulation
- Terminal service tests use PTY mocking
- WebSocket tests may need adjustment for v1 limitations

**Cross-Validation Notes**:
- **Alex**: "v1 served its purpose for initial setup but lacks production realism"
- **Sarah**: "v2 addresses my concerns about backend timing and resource constraints"

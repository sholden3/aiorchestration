- [x] Add comprehensive error boundaries (IPC, backend)
- [ ] Establish monitoring and alerting (partial)

## Phase 1.5: Governance Architecture Enhancement üöß IN PROGRESS
**Added 2025-01-28**: Architectural change for cross-language governance
- [x] Refine pattern detection to eliminate false positives
- [x] Implement context-aware validation with exemptions
- [x] Create universal exemption system (exemptions.yml)
- [ ] Add semantic analysis for patterns
- [ ] Support multi-language governance (partial)

*See [cross-language-exemption-architecture.md](../decisions/cross-language-exemption-architecture.md) for details*

## Phase 1.5b: AI Hallucination Detection üöß IN PROGRESS

*See [hallucination-detection-round-table.md](../decisions/hallucination-detection-round-table.md) for details*

## Phase 2: Real AI Integration  
- [ ] Replace simulated agent responses with actual AI calls
- [ ] Implement real PTY terminal integration
- [ ] Add Claude CLI integration for production use
- [ ] Create agent capability management

## Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Performance optimization and load testing

- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] User documentation and training

## Phase Breakdown - Remaining Work

### Phase 0: Current State Assessment ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Jest infrastructure operational
- Tests revealing implementation bugs
- 58% IPC tests passing, 12% Terminal tests passing

### Phase 1: Fix Implementation Bugs (In Progress)
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Alex's Focus**: 
- Fix remaining 5 IPC test failures
- Resolve NgZone dependency injection in Terminal service
- Ensure consistent error handling patterns

**Sarah's Focus**:
- Validate backend mock behavior matches production
- Review circuit breaker state transitions
- Ensure resource cleanup patterns

**Success Criteria**: 
- IPC tests: >90% pass rate
- Terminal tests: >80% pass rate
- No memory leaks detected

### Phase 2: Complete Test Coverage
**Timeline**: 3-4 days  
**Objectives**:
- Add tests for all critical paths
- Implement integration tests for cross-system boundaries
- Add performance benchmarks

**Success Criteria**:
- Frontend coverage: >80%
- Backend coverage: >85%
- All integration points tested

### Phase 3: Fix Remaining High/Medium Priority Issues
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Focus Areas**:
- H1: WebSocket connection limits
- H2: Complete IPC error boundaries
- H3: Database initialization race condition
- M1-M2: Performance optimizations

**Success Criteria**:
- All high priority issues resolved
- Performance benchmarks met
- No race conditions detected

### Phase 4: Production Hardening
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Activities**:
- Stress testing with realistic load
- Memory leak detection under load
- Error recovery validation
- Documentation updates

**Success Criteria**:
- 8-hour stability test passes
- Memory usage stable under load
- All error scenarios handled gracefully

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
**Timeline**: 3-4 days  
**Final Steps**:
- Production configuration
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring setup
- Runbook validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Clean deployment to staging
- All monitors reporting correctly
- Runbooks tested by someone unfamiliar with system

**Orchestrated by Alex Novak & Dr. Sarah Chen**  
*"The best architecture is code that works perfectly, fails gracefully, documents itself completely, and teaches the next developer exactly why every decision was made‚Äîespecially when they're debugging it during a production crisis."*

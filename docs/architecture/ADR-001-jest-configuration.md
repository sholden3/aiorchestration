# Architecture Decision Record: Jest Configuration

**ADR-001**: Jest Testing Infrastructure Configuration  
**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Architects**: Alex Novak & Dr. Sarah Chen  

## Context

The AI Development Assistant project required migration from Karma to Jest for testing Angular 17 components with Electron integration. The configuration needed to handle:
- Angular component testing with proper TestBed setup
- Electron IPC mock infrastructure with realistic backend simulation
- Memory management and resource cleanup
- Cross-system integration testing

## Decision

### 1. Simplified Single Configuration
**Decision**: Use a single jest.config.js file without projects array.

**Rationale** (Alex):
- Jest's 'projects' feature doesn't support testTimeout at project level
- Single configuration reduces complexity for 3 AM debugging
- maxWorkers=1 already provides necessary test isolation

**Rationale** (Sarah):
- Simpler configuration reduces failure points
- Easier to understand resource allocation
- Clear execution flow for troubleshooting

### 2. Test Sequencer Removal
**Decision**: Commented out custom test sequencer reference.

**Rationale**:
- No test ordering dependencies identified
- Default alphabetical ordering sufficient with maxWorkers=1
- Removes configuration debt from incomplete implementation

**Validation**: Tests run consistently with:
- `--runInBand` (sequential)
- `--maxWorkers=4` (parallel)
- Default settings

### 3. Enhanced Electron Mock (v2)
**Decision**: Replaced basic mocks with realistic backend resource simulation.

**Features**:
- Backend resource state tracking (CPU, memory, connections)
- Burst load pattern support (25 calls in 500ms)
- Database maintenance window simulation (15-second delays)
- Circuit breaker and backpressure mechanisms
- Backward compatibility with v1 test methods

**Rationale** (Sarah):
- Tests should reflect production resource constraints
- Failure modes need realistic simulation
- Backend timing patterns must be testable

**Rationale** (Alex):
- Electron process coordination needs accurate mocking
- Memory leak detection requires proper state tracking
- Integration boundaries need defensive patterns

### 4. Balanced Coverage Thresholds
**Decision**: Set coverage thresholds to 70% (reduced from 80%).

**Thresholds**:
```javascript
{
  statements: 70,
  branches: 60,
  functions: 70,
  lines: 70
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Emergency fixes shouldn't be blocked by coverage
- Complex conditionals may have unreachable branches
- Utility functions may have defensive code paths

### 5. Resource Management Settings
**Decision**: Enforce strict resource limits.

**Settings**:
- `maxWorkers: 1` - Prevent Electron process conflicts
- `testTimeout: 45000` - Handle backend maintenance delays
- `detectOpenHandles: true` - Catch resource leaks
- `forceExit: true` - Prevent hanging processes

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Jest runs without configuration errors
- ✅ Tests execute consistently regardless of execution pattern
- ✅ Realistic backend behavior simulation in tests
- ✅ Clear error messages for debugging
- ✅ Memory leak detection enabled
- ✅ Proper cleanup between tests

### Negative
- ⚠️ Slower test execution with maxWorkers=1
- ⚠️ Higher memory usage with enhanced mocks (~8MB vs ~5MB)
- ⚠️ Some existing tests require updates for v2 mocks

### Neutral
- Tests revealing actual implementation bugs (4 IPC service failures)
- NgZone dependency injection issues in terminal tests (pre-existing)
- Configuration simplified but still comprehensive

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Jest configuration fixed and operational
- [x] Test sequencer reference removed
- [x] Enhanced Electron mocks (v2) with backward compatibility
- [x] Archival procedures established
- [x] Validation across execution patterns

### Pending
- [ ] Fix IPC service implementation bugs revealed by tests
- [ ] Resolve NgZone dependency injection in terminal tests
- [ ] Add more test coverage for new components

## Monitoring

### Success Metrics
- Test execution time: < 30 seconds for full suite
- Memory usage: < 400MB peak during tests
- Configuration stability: No changes needed for 30 days

### Health Indicators
- All developers can run tests locally
- CI pipeline executes tests reliably
- Test failures indicate real bugs, not infrastructure issues

## Rollback Procedure

If configuration causes issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (< 2 minutes):
   ```bash
   cp archive/test_infrastructure/2025-08-26_jest.config_v1.js jest.config.js
   cp archive/test_infrastructure/2025-08-26_test-setup-electron_v1_baseline.ts src/test-setup-electron.ts
   npm test -- --passWithNoTests
   ```

2. **Validation**:
   - Confirm tests execute
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify CI pipeline

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Document failure mode
   - Update this ADR with findings
   - Plan remediation

## Approval

**Alex Novak**: ✅ "Configuration passes the 3 AM test - clear, debuggable, maintainable"  
**Dr. Sarah Chen**: ✅ "Resource simulation provides realistic test scenarios, failure modes properly handled"

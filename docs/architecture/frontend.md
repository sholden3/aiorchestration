## Data Flow
### Client-Server Communication
- **HTTP Client:** Angular HttpClient with interceptors for authentication and error handling
- **API Layer:** Typed service classes for each backend API endpoint
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Caching Strategy:** Service-level caching with TTL and invalidation strategies

### State Updates
- **Action Creators:** Service methods that emit state changes
- **Reducers:** Service methods that transform state based on actions
- **Selectors:** Derived state calculations using RxJS operators
- **Side Effects:** HTTP calls, IPC communication, and external integrations

## Routing Architecture
### Route Structure

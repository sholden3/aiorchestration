## Critical Debt Items

### C1: Terminal Service Memory Leak
**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Code Quality  
**Created:** January 25, 2025  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks  
**Assigned To:** Alex Novak  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY FIXED

**Description:**  
Memory leak in TerminalService caused by singleton pattern and improper cleanup of terminal instances and WebSocket connections.

**Impact:**  
- Memory usage grows continuously during terminal operations
- Application becomes unusable after extended use
- Potential system instability in production

**Root Cause:**  
TerminalService implemented as module singleton with global providers, preventing proper component lifecycle management and cleanup.

**Resolution Implemented:**  
- Converted from module singleton to component-scoped pattern
- Removed TerminalService from app.module providers
- Added providers to main-layout and terminal components
- Proper cleanup verified with ngOnDestroy lifecycle

**Validation:**  
- 21/21 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Memory leak eliminated in testing
- Component lifecycle properly managed

**Files Affected:**
- `ai-assistant/src/app/modules/terminal/terminal.service.ts`
- `ai-assistant/src/app/app.module.ts`
- `ai-assistant/src/app/components/main-layout/main-layout.component.ts`

### C2: Cache Disk I/O Failure Cascade
**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Infrastructure  
**Created:** January 20, 2025  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week  
**Assigned To:** Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Integration tests needed)

**Description:**  
Cache system fails catastrophically when disk I/O errors occur, causing complete system failure instead of graceful degradation.

**Impact:**  
- Complete system failure when cache disk fills or becomes unavailable
- No fallback mechanism for cache operations
- Data loss potential during disk failures

**Root Cause:**  
Cache implementation lacks proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for disk I/O failures.

**Solution Implemented:**  
- Memory-only fallback mode with automatic recovery
- Disk health monitoring with proactive detection
- Atomic writes with rollback capability
- Exponential backoff recovery strategy

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- ✅ Memory fallback mode functional
- ✅ Disk health monitoring implemented
- ✅ Atomic write operations
- ⚠️ Integration tests for failure scenarios

**Next Steps:**  
- Add integration tests for disk failure scenarios
- Validate recovery under various failure conditions

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Created:** January 18, 2025  
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days  
**Assigned To:** Alex Novak & Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Manual verification needed)

**Description:**  
Process startup coordination failures between Electron main process and backend services causing inconsistent application state.

**Impact:**  
- Application fails to start reliably
- Backend services may not be available when frontend initializes
- Race conditions in service dependency initialization

**Root Cause:**  
Lack of proper coordination and retry logic between process initialization sequences.

**Solution Implemented:**  
- Comprehensive retry logic with correlation IDs
- Exponential backoff for service availability
- Already-running detection to prevent conflicts
- Configuration file `config.js` for process coordination

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- ✅ Retry logic implemented
- ✅ Coordination IDs tracking
- ✅ Exponential backoff
- ⚠️ Manual verification needed

**Next Steps:**

**Created:** January 15, 2025  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 week  
**Assigned To:** Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** ❓ UNTESTED

**Description:**  
WebSocket connections may accumulate without proper cleanup, leading to resource exhaustion and connection limits being exceeded.

**Impact:**  
- Application becomes unresponsive under high load
- WebSocket connection limits exceeded
- Memory usage growth from uncleaned connections

**Current State:**  
WebSocket manager exists but limits not validated through testing.

**Proposed Solution:**

**Description:**  
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between Electron main and renderer processes lacks comprehensive error handling and circuit breaker patterns.

**Impact:**  
- IPC failures cascade to application instability
- No graceful degradation when communication fails
- User experience severely impacted by IPC errors

**Current State:**  
Service implemented with circuit breaker, 7/12 tests passing (58% pass rate).

**Issues Fixed:**  
- Invoke pattern mismatch resolved
- Consistent error handling implemented

**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Infrastructure  
**Created:** January 10, 2025  
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days  
**Assigned To:** Dr. Sarah Chen  
**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

**Description:**  
Database initialization suffers from race conditions when multiple processes or requests attempt to initialize concurrently.

**Impact:**  
- Application startup failures
- Inconsistent database state
- Data corruption potential

**Solution Implemented:**  
Thread-safe initialization with state tracking and _ensure_initialized() guards.

**Validation:**  
- 12/12 unit tests passing (100%)
- 503 responses during initialization
- State tracking prevents race conditions

**Next Steps:**  
Full integration testing when environment ready.

### M2: Cache Architecture Consolidation
**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** Architecture  
**Created:** December 10, 2024

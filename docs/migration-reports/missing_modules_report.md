# Missing Modules Report - AI Assistant Backend
**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Updated:** 2025-09-04
**Recovery Decision:** DEC-2025-010  

## Executive Summary

### Stats:
- **Successfully Recovered:** 12 modules from RecoveryProject
- **Created as Placeholders:** 8 files (6 new, 1 moved, 1 validation script)
- **Still Missing:** 6 modules (not found anywhere, likely future features)
- **Archive Search:** Completed - modules not in any .archive folder

### Key Finding:
The missing imports appear to be for future planned features that were never implemented. The main.py file has imports for modules that don't exist in any backup or archive.

## Summary
The backend main.py file requires multiple modules that are either missing or need to be recovered from RecoveryProject.

## Successfully Recovered Modules
These were found in RecoveryProject and recovered:

1. **cache_manager.py** - Found and recovered
2. **persona_manager.py** - Found and recovered  
3. **database_manager.py** - Found and recovered
4. **metrics_collector.py** - Found and recovered
5. **cache_errors.py** - Found and recovered
6. **cache_abstraction.py** - Found and recovered
7. **three_tier_cache.py** - Found and recovered
8. **database/models.py** - Found and recovered
9. **database/database.py** - Found and recovered
10. **database_schema.sql** - Found and recovered
11. **init_database.py** - Found and recovered
12. **check-pty.js** - Found and recovered

## Modules Created as Placeholders/Boilerplate
These files were created during recovery because they weren't in RecoveryProject:

### Backend Core Infrastructure (Created Sept 3, 2025):
1. **apps/api/claude_integration.py** 
   - Placeholder implementation for Claude API integration
   - Basic async methods for processing requests
   - Returns mock responses

2. **apps/api/cache_circuit_breaker.py**
   - Wrapper around existing circuit_breaker.py
   - Adds cache-specific functionality (hit/miss tracking)
   - Extends CircuitBreaker class

3. **apps/api/ai_orchestration_engine.py**
   - Placeholder task orchestration system
   - Implements task queue with workers
   - Basic task states (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
   - AITask model and AIOrchestrationEngine class

4. **apps/api/core/__init__.py**
   - Python package initialization
   - Exports: get_config, get_backend_url, is_development

5. **apps/api/core/auth.py**
   - Basic authentication placeholder
   - AuthManager class with mock methods
   - verify_token, get_current_user stubs

6. **apps/api/core/port_discovery.py**
   - Complete port discovery implementation
   - PortDiscovery class
   - Finds available ports, checks port availability
   - Default ports: backend=8000, frontend=4200

### Files Moved/Modified:
7. **apps/api/core/config.py**
   - MOVED from apps/api/config.py to core/config.py
   - Added compatibility functions at end:
     - get_config()
     - get_backend_url()
     - is_development()

### Validation Scripts Created:
8. **apps/validate_recovery.py**
   - Recovery validation script
   - 30 validation checks
   - No Unicode characters (Windows compatible)

## Archive Search Results
Searched .archive folder for missing modules:

### Archives Checked:
- `.archive/20250903_223224_dependency_recovery/` - Contains backup of apps directory
- `.archive/old-governance-modules-20250902_135819/` - Contains old governance structure
- `.archive/governance-merge-20250902_213811/` - Contains governance merge files
- All other archive folders from September 2, 2025

### Findings:
- **NOT FOUND in archives:**
  - unified_governance_orchestrator.py
  - persona_orchestration_enhanced.py  
  - conversation_manager.py
  - additional_api_endpoints.py
  - agent_terminal_manager.py
  - claude_terminal.py (main.py imports it but file doesn't exist)

### Found in Current Project:
- **updated_api_endpoints.py** - EXISTS in apps/api/
  - Contains: rules_router, practices_router, templates_router, sessions_router
  - This file was successfully recovered and is working

## Still Missing Modules
These are imported in main.py but not found anywhere (including archives):

### Core Missing Imports (from main.py lines 67-75):
```python
from unified_governance_orchestrator import UnifiedGovernanceOrchestrator
from persona_orchestration_enhanced import PersonaOrchestrationEnhanced
from conversation_manager import ConversationManager
from additional_api_endpoints import add_additional_routes
from updated_api_endpoints import rules_router, practices_router, templates_router, sessions_router
from agent_terminal_manager import agent_terminal_manager, AgentType
from claude_terminal import claude_terminal  # Note: claude_terminal.py exists but may need updating
```

### Files That Exist But May Need Verification:
- **websocket_manager.py** - Exists (recovered from RecoveryProject)
- **database_service.py** - Exists (already in apps/api)
- **circuit_breaker.py** - Exists (already in apps/api)
- **config.py** - Exists (but also have core/config.py - may be duplicate)

## Import Structure Issues Found

### Issue 1: Module vs Package Imports
- **Problem:** cache_manager.py tries both absolute and relative imports
- **Location:** Lines 27-38 in cache_manager.py
- **Current Code:**
```python
try:
    from cache_errors import ...
    from cache_circuit_breaker import ...
except ImportError:
    from .cache_errors import ...
    from .cache_circuit_breaker import ...
```

### Issue 2: Config Import Confusion
- **Problem:** Two config files exist
  - `apps/api/config.py` (original)
  - `backend/core/config.py` (moved during recovery)
- **main.py imports from both:**
  - Line 55: `from core.config import get_config, get_backend_url, is_development`
  - Line 63: `from config import Config`

## Recommended Search Patterns
To find these in your repository, search for:

1. **File names:**
   - unified_governance_orchestrator*
   - persona_orchestration*
   - conversation_manager*
   - additional_api_endpoints*
   - updated_api_endpoints*
   - agent_terminal_manager*

2. **Class/Function names:**
   - UnifiedGovernanceOrchestrator
   - PersonaOrchestrationEnhanced
   - ConversationManager
   - add_additional_routes
   - rules_router
   - practices_router
   - templates_router
   - sessions_router
   - AgentType
   - agent_terminal_manager

3. **Check these locations:**
   - governance/ directory (some imports reference governance.core.*)
   - Root project directory
   - Other branches in git
   - .archive/ directories
   - Any backup folders

## RecoveryProject Paths
All recovered files came from:
```
RecoveryProject/aiorchestration-ecca6fd665b0a474369509cb29c4aeaed35c57aa/aiorchestration-ecca6fd665b0a474369509cb29c4aeaed35c57aa/apps/api/
```

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Current Situation:
1. **updated_api_endpoints.py** - Already exists and working
2. **Missing modules** appear to be from a newer version of the application
3. These modules are NOT in:
   - RecoveryProject backup
   - Any .archive folders  
   - Current governance/ directory
   - tests/ directory

### Likely Explanation:
The missing imports in main.py (lines 67-75) appear to be from future development that hasn't been implemented yet:
- UnifiedGovernanceOrchestrator - Planned governance integration
- PersonaOrchestrationEnhanced - Enhanced persona system
- ConversationManager - Conversation state management
- additional_api_endpoints - Additional API routes
- agent_terminal_manager - Terminal agent management
- claude_terminal - Claude-specific terminal interface

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Comment out unused imports** in main.py for now
2. **Or create stub implementations** that satisfy imports but don't break functionality
3. **Check git history** to see if these were ever implemented
4. **Verify with team** if these are planned future features

## Notes
- The application has more sophisticated module organization than what's in RecoveryProject
- Many modules appear to be newer additions not present in the recovery snapshot
- The governance integration seems to be a recent addition (governance.core.runtime_governance imports)
- Archive search confirms these modules were never implemented in this codebase

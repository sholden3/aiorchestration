## üöÄ How to Use the Dynamic Persona Framework

### Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Invoking a Specialist
When you encounter a domain-specific issue:

```markdown
[SPECIALIST INVOCATION REQUEST]
Issue: [Describe the problem]
Domain: [Performance/Security/Database/Real-time/UI-UX]
Severity: [Critical/High/Medium]
Request: Invoke [Specialist Name] to provide expert guidance
```

#### 2. During Specialist Intervention
The specialist will:
- Immediately assess the situation
- Provide specific technical solutions
- Make binding decisions (documented in DECISIONS.md)
- Transfer knowledge before exiting

#### 3. After Specialist Exit
Core architects (Alex & Sarah) will:
- Implement the specialist's recommendations
- Maintain system continuity
- Document lessons learned

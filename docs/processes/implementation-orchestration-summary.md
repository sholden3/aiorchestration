## 🎭 ORCHESTRATION DEMONSTRATION

### How Our Framework Worked

1. **Problem Identification** (Core Architects)
   - Alex: "Zero tests, can't commit"
   - Sarah: "No documentation structure"

2. **Specialist Invocation** (Sequential)
   - Sam → Testing strategy
   - Riley → CI/CD infrastructure
   - Quinn → Documentation architecture
   - Each specialist entered, contributed, exited

3. **Integration** (Core Architects)
   - Alex integrated frontend aspects
   - Sarah integrated backend aspects
   - Both created unified plan

4. **Documentation** (Complete)
   - All decisions in DECISIONS.md
   - Master plan created
   - Documentation index established
   - CLAUDE.md updated with references

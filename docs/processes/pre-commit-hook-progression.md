# Pre-Commit Hook Progressive Standards

**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Current Version**: v0.1 (Week 1)  
**Next Upgrade**: v0.4 (Week 2) - Ready to deploy  

---

## üìà Progressive Standards Timeline

### Week 1: v0.1 (CURRENT)
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE  
**Focus**: Minimal blocking, establish baseline

**Blocking Checks**:
- Python syntax errors
- JavaScript syntax errors  
- Exposed secrets
- Large files (>10MB)

**Warning Only**:
- Documentation standards
- Test coverage
- TODO/FIXME markers

**Tracking Only**:
- File counts
- Line changes

---

### Week 2: v0.4 (READY TO DEPLOY)
**Status**: üì¶ PREPARED  
**Focus**: Documentation becomes mandatory, test awareness

**New Blocking Checks**:
- Documentation headers required for all code files
- Import validation (Python)

**New Warnings**:
- Missing test files for source files
- TypeScript type checking
- Enhanced TODO/FIXME tracking

**Improvements**:
- Better secret detection patterns
- Technical debt tracking to JSON file
- More detailed reporting

---

### Week 3: v0.8 (PLANNED)
**Target Date**: 2025-02-03  
**Focus**: Test coverage enforcement, type safety

**Will Become Blocking**:
- Test files must exist for all source files
- TypeScript type checking must pass
- Python type hints required for functions
- Maximum file complexity (cyclomatic)

**New Features**:
- Minimum test coverage thresholds
- Linting becomes blocking
- Architecture compliance checks
- Performance impact analysis

---

### Week 4: v1.0 (FINAL)
**Target Date**: 2025-02-10  
**Focus**: Production-ready standards

**Full Enforcement**:
- 80% test coverage minimum
- All documentation complete
- No TODO/FIXME allowed
- Security scanning
- License compliance
- Dependency vulnerability checks
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility standards (for UI)

## üöÄ How to Upgrade

### Moving from v0.1 to v0.4

```bash
# Backup current hook
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit-v0.1-backup

# Deploy v0.4
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit-v0.4 .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Test with a sample commit
git add -A
git commit -m "test: Testing v0.4 standards"
```

### Rollback if Needed

```bash
# Restore previous version
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit-v0.1-backup .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## üìä Current Status Analysis

### v0.1 Performance (Week 1)
- **Commits Blocked**: 1 (Python syntax error)
- **Warnings Issued**: ~5-10 per commit
- **Developer Friction**: LOW
- **Code Quality Impact**: ESTABLISHING BASELINE

### Expected v0.4 Impact (Week 2)
- **Additional Blocks**: ~2-3 per commit initially (documentation)
- **New Warnings**: ~10-15 (missing tests)
- **Developer Friction**: MEDIUM
- **Code Quality Impact**: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

## üí° Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run pre-commit checks locally**:
```bash
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

2. **Fix warnings proactively** - They become errors in later versions

3. **Add documentation as you code** - Don't wait for enforcement

4. **Write tests alongside features** - Avoid technical debt

### For Team Leads

1. **Communicate upcoming changes** - Give 1 week notice before upgrades

2. **Track metrics** - Monitor rejection rates and adjust if needed

3. **Provide tooling** - Scripts to auto-fix common issues

4. **Celebrate progress** - Recognize when standards improve

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Timing

If progression is too fast/slow, adjust in hook file:

```bash
# In pre-commit hook header
PROGRESSION_WEEK=1  # Change to 2, 3, or 4 to jump ahead
```

### Exempting Files

Add patterns to skip certain checks:

```bash
# Add to hook
EXEMPT_PATTERNS="vendor/|third_party/|generated/"
```

### Project-Specific Rules

Add custom checks in Level 2 section:

```bash
# Custom business logic check
if grep -q "deprecated_function" $file; then
    echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Using deprecated function"
    ((WARNINGS++))
fi
```

---

## üìù Technical Debt Tracking

### Current Debt (v0.1)
- TypeScript files not checked by Node
- No test file verification
- Basic documentation checking only
- TODO/FIXME allowed without tracking

### Debt Resolution Plan
- **Week 2**: Start tracking in JSON
- **Week 3**: Require debt tickets for new items
- **Week 4**: Block new debt, require paydown

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Hook not running**:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Too many false positives**:
- Adjust patterns in hook
- Add exemptions for generated files
- Use `--no-verify` for emergency commits

**Performance issues**:
- Cache syntax check results
- Parallel processing for large commits
- Skip unchanged files

## üìÖ Progression Decision Log

### 2025-01-27: v0.4 Prepared
- **Rationale**: Team has adapted to v0.1, ready for documentation enforcement
- **Changes**: Documentation blocking, test awareness added
- **Risk**: Medium - may slow commits initially
- **Mitigation**: Clear error messages, auto-fix scripts provided

### Next Decision: 2025-02-03
- Review v0.4 metrics
- Decide on v0.8 deployment
- Adjust based on team feedback

**Remember**: Progressive standards are about sustainable improvement, not perfection from day one.

# Three-Persona Collaboration: Terminal Memory Leak Crisis

**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Participants**: Alex Novak v3.0, Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2, Maya Patel v3.0 (Specialist)  
**Issue**: Critical Memory Leak C1 - Terminal Service  

---

## ðŸš¨ Crisis Scenario

**Alex v3.0**: "We've got a critical issue. The terminal service is leaking memoryâ€”Chrome DevTools shows 2GB consumption after 30 minutes of use. This is the same pattern I saw during the Silent Memory Leak incident in Year 9. Sarah, what's the backend looking like?"

**Sarah v1.2**: "WebSocket connections are accumulating. I'm seeing 847 event listeners on the terminal componentâ€”classic listener leak pattern. My monitoring shows each PTY session creates 12 WebSocket subscriptions that never get cleaned up. This is heading toward my 2021 WebSocket memory incident all over again."

**Alex v3.0**: "We need UI feedback for users before this crashes their browser. The executive dashboard can't go blank again."

## ðŸŽ¨ Specialist Entry

**Maya v3.0**: "I see the crisis. 847 listeners means you're not cleaning up resize observers or scroll listeners. I dealt with this exact pattern during Black Friday 2023. Let me analyze the UI implications and design a graceful degradation strategy."

*Maya reviews the terminal component code*

**Maya v3.0**: "Three immediate issues from a UI perspective:
1. No visual feedback when approaching memory limits
2. Animation frames continuing even when terminal is off-screen
3. No user-recoverable state when memory exhaustion hits"

## ðŸ”§ Collaborative Solution Design

### Memory Management Architecture

**Sarah v1.2**: "Here's my backend circuit breaker pattern for WebSocket connections:"
```python
class TerminalConnectionManager:
    MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100
    MAX_LISTENERS_PER_CONNECTION = 10
    
    def add_listener(self, connection_id, listener):
        if self.listener_count[connection_id] >= self.MAX_LISTENERS_PER_CONNECTION:
            raise ListenerLimitExceeded()
        # Force cleanup of oldest listener if approaching limit
        if self.listener_count[connection_id] > 8:
            self.cleanup_oldest_listener(connection_id)
```

**Alex v3.0**: "I'll implement the frontend cleanup pattern with correlation IDs for debugging:"
```typescript
class TerminalService implements OnDestroy {
  private listeners = new Map<string, () => void>();
  private intersectionObserver: IntersectionObserver;
  
  ngOnDestroy(): void {
    // Alex's 3 AM debugging rule: explicit cleanup with logging
    this.listeners.forEach((cleanup, id) => {
      console.log(`[CLEANUP] Terminal listener: ${id}`);
      cleanup();
    });
    this.intersectionObserver?.disconnect();
  }
}
```

**Maya v3.0**: "And here's the UI feedback system with accessibility-aware warnings:"
```typescript
// Maya's progressive degradation UI pattern
@Component({
  template: `
    <mat-card [class.maya-memory-warning]="memoryWarning$ | async"
              [class.maya-memory-critical]="memoryCritical$ | async">
      
      <!-- Accessible warning banner -->
      <mat-banner *ngIf="memoryWarning$ | async" role="alert">
        <mat-icon>warning</mat-icon>
        <span i18n>High memory usage detected. Some features may be limited.</span>
        <button mat-button (click)="cleanupInactiveTerminals()">
          <span i18n>Free Memory</span>
        </button>
      </mat-banner>
      
      <!-- Terminal content with performance optimization -->
      <div class="terminal-container"
           [attr.aria-busy]="loading$ | async"
           [class.maya-reduced-motion]="reducedMotion">
        <ng-content></ng-content>
      </div>
    </mat-card>
  `,
  styles: [`
    /* Maya's memory-aware visual states */
    .maya-memory-warning {
      @include maya-respectful-motion(
        'border-color, box-shadow',
        'border-color',
        200ms
      );
      border: 2px solid mat-color($warn, 300);
    }
    
    .maya-memory-critical {
      border: 3px solid mat-color($warn, 500);
      animation: maya-pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
      
      @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        animation: none;
        background: mat-color($warn, 50);
      }
    }
    
    /* Performance optimization for off-screen terminals */
    .terminal-container:not(.visible) {
      animation-play-state: paused;
      will-change: auto;
    }
  `]
})
```

## ðŸ“Š Integrated Monitoring Strategy

**Sarah v1.2**: "I'll add memory metrics to my monitoring:"
```python
async def get_terminal_metrics():
    return {
        "websocket_connections": len(active_connections),
        "total_listeners": sum(connection.listener_count for connection in active_connections),
        "memory_usage_mb": process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024,
        "correlation_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),  # Alex's correlation tracking
        "ui_state": "degraded" if memory_critical else "normal"  # Maya's UI states
    }
```

**Alex v3.0**: "Perfect. I'll correlate those metrics with frontend memory profiling:"
```typescript
// Correlation across all three domains
interface TerminalHealthCheck {
  backend: SarahMetrics;      // WebSocket and resource stats
  frontend: AlexMetrics;      // IPC and memory profiling
  ui: MayaMetrics;           // Animation frame timing and user feedback
  correlationId: string;     // Unified debugging
  timestamp: number;
}
```

**Maya v3.0**: "I'll ensure the degradation is visually clear but not panic-inducing:"
```scss
// Progressive visual degradation based on memory thresholds
@mixin maya-memory-states() {
  &[data-memory-usage="low"] {
    // Full animations enabled
    @include maya-full-motion();
  }
  
  &[data-memory-usage="medium"] {
    // Reduce non-essential animations
    @include maya-reduced-motion();
    .decorative-animation { display: none; }
  }
  
  &[data-memory-usage="high"] {
    // Essential interactions only
    @include maya-essential-only();
    will-change: auto;
    animation: none;
  }
  
  &[data-memory-usage="critical"] {
    // Survival mode - static UI with warnings
    * { 
      animation: none !important;
      transition: none !important;
    }
    @include maya-critical-warning-state();
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Specialist Decision Documentation

**Maya v3.0**: "Here are my binding design decisions for terminal memory management:"

### DECISIONS.md Entry

```markdown
### 2025-01-27 - Maya Patel - Terminal Memory Leak UI Response

**Invoked By**: Alex Novak  
**Context**: Terminal service consuming 2GB RAM, needs graceful degradation

**Decisions Made**:
1. **Progressive Animation Degradation**: Implement 4-tier system (low/medium/high/critical) with automatic animation reduction
2. **Visual Memory Warnings**: Non-intrusive banner at 70% threshold, critical warning at 90%
3. **Accessibility-First Alerts**: ARIA live regions for memory warnings, maintained functionality in reduced-motion mode
4. **Off-screen Optimization**: Pause all animations and remove will-change for invisible terminals

**Binding Constraints**:
- Memory warning UI must not add more than 5ms to render time
- All states must be accessible with screen readers
- Visual feedback must work in both light and dark themes
- Degradation must be reversible when memory recovers

**Integration Impact**:
- Frontend (Alex): Must implement IntersectionObserver for visibility detection
- Backend (Sarah): Must provide memory metrics via WebSocket
- Testing: Requires memory leak simulation in E2E tests
```

## âœ… Resolution & Handoff

**Maya v3.0**: "My work here is complete. The UI will now gracefully degrade as memory pressure increases, giving users control over cleanup. The animations automatically pause when terminals are off-screen. Alex, you have the implementation patterns. Sarah, the memory thresholds are defined for your circuit breakers."

**[EXITING: Maya Patel]**

**Alex v3.0**: "Thanks Maya. I'll implement the IntersectionObserver pattern and ensure all terminal instances register for cleanup. The executive dashboard will show memory warnings before critical thresholds."

**Sarah v1.2**: "I'm adding memory-based connection limits to the WebSocket manager. With Maya's UI feedback, users will understand why new connections might be rejected. This prevents the cascade failure I saw in 2021."

**Alex v3.0**: "Let's also add this to our runbook. Next time someone gets paged at 3 AM for memory issues, they'll have Maya's degradation patterns ready."

**Sarah v1.2**: "Agreed. What breaks first? Terminal animations. How do we know? Memory warning banners. What's Plan B? Progressive degradation to static UI. This is solid."

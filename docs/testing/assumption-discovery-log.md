## üîç Active Discoveries

### 2025-01-27 - IPC Service - Security Assumption
**Discovered By**: Alex Novak v3.0
**During**: Writing IPC service unit tests
**Original Assumption**: All IPC channels would be statically defined and pre-validated
**Actual Behavior**: Channels can be dynamically created at runtime, need runtime validation
**Impact Level**: HIGH
**Impact on Governance**: Governance hooks need to intercept and validate dynamic channel creation
**Required Changes**: 
- [x] Implement channel whitelist with wildcard support
- [x] Add runtime validation in IPC service
- [ ] Update ipc-communication.md with dynamic channel patterns
- [ ] Add governance hook for channel registration
**Hook Integration Notes**: Need pre-channel-creation hook for governance approval
**File References**: 
- `src/app/services/ipc.service.ts`
- `docs/architecture/ipc-communication.md`

### 2025-01-27 - Cache Manager - Performance Assumption
**Discovered By**: Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2
**During**: Implementing circuit breaker pattern
**Original Assumption**: Cache operations would always complete within 100ms
**Actual Behavior**: Cold cache operations can take 500ms+ when loading from disk
**Impact Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact on Governance**: AI governance needs different timeout thresholds for hot vs cold cache
**Required Changes**: 
- [ ] Implement adaptive timeouts based on cache tier
- [ ] Add performance monitoring per tier
- [ ] Update backend-architecture.md with realistic performance expectations
**Hook Integration Notes**: Governance hooks need tier-aware timeout configuration
**File References**:
- `backend/cache_manager.py`
- `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md`

### 2025-01-27 - Terminal Service - Memory Management Assumption
**Discovered By**: Alex Novak v3.0
**During**: Fixing memory leak (C1)
**Original Assumption**: Angular would automatically clean up service listeners
**Actual Behavior**: Root-level services persist across route changes, listeners accumulate
**Impact Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact on Governance**: Terminal operation hooks must include cleanup verification
**Required Changes**: 
- [x] Implement explicit cleanup in ngOnDestroy
- [x] Add listener tracking mechanism
- [ ] Update all services with similar patterns
- [ ] Add memory leak detection tests
**Hook Integration Notes**: Governance needs to monitor resource cleanup
**File References**:
- `src/app/services/terminal.service.ts`
- `docs/fixes/C1-terminal-service-memory-leak.md`

## üéØ Patterns Emerging

### Pattern 1: Defensive Programming Gaps
**Observation**: Many components assume happy path without defensive error handling
**Examples**: 
- IPC service throwing instead of graceful degradation
- Cache manager without circuit breaker
- Terminal service without resource limits
**Recommendation**: All services need defensive patterns applied systematically

### Pattern 2: Lifecycle Management
**Observation**: Angular service lifecycle not well understood
**Examples**:
- Memory leaks from unmanaged listeners
- Observables not unsubscribed
- Resources not released
**Recommendation**: Standardize cleanup patterns across all services

### Pattern 3: Performance Expectations
**Observation**: Unrealistic performance assumptions throughout
**Examples**:
- Cache operations assumed instant
- API calls without timeout consideration
- No backpressure handling
**Recommendation**: Establish realistic performance baselines through testing

## üîÑ Framework Corrections Needed

Based on discoveries so far:

### Documentation Updates Required
1. **ipc-communication.md**: Add dynamic channel patterns
2. **backend-architecture.md**: Update performance characteristics
3. **frontend-architecture.md**: Add lifecycle management patterns
4. **security-boundaries.md**: Enhance runtime validation requirements

### New Patterns to Document
1. **Defensive Service Pattern**: Template for error handling
2. **Resource Cleanup Pattern**: Lifecycle management template
3. **Performance Monitoring Pattern**: Baseline establishment

### Test Strategy Adjustments
1. Add memory leak detection tests
2. Include performance regression tests
3. Add chaos engineering for timeout scenarios

## üìà Impact on AI Governance Hooks

### High Priority Hook Points Discovered
1. **Dynamic Channel Creation**: Need pre-creation validation
2. **Cache Tier Selection**: Need tier-aware governance
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Need cleanup verification
4. **Performance Degradation**: Need adaptive thresholds

### Governance Framework Adjustments
1. Add runtime validation capabilities
2. Implement tier-aware policies
3. Add resource monitoring hooks
4. Create adaptive threshold management

1. ‚úÖ Memory leak in terminal service (C1) - FIXED
2. ‚è≥ Cache circuit breaker implementation - IN PROGRESS
3. ‚è≥ IPC error boundaries - IN PROGRESS
4. ‚ùì WebSocket resource limits - TO BE TESTED

### Documentation Gaps Identified

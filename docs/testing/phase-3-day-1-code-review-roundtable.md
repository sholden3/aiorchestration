## üí¨ PERSONA ROUNDTABLE REVIEW

### üõ°Ô∏è Dr. Sarah Chen v1.2 - Backend Architecture Review

**Reviewing**: C2 Cache Disk I/O Fix Design

**THREE QUESTIONS VALIDATION**:
```python
‚úÖ What breaks first? 
   - Clearly identified: Disk I/O or file corruption
   - Proper exception hierarchy used
   
‚úÖ How do we know?
   - Comprehensive metrics tracking
   - Disk health monitoring every minute
   - Circuit breaker state tracking
   - Correlation IDs throughout
   
‚úÖ What's Plan B?
   - Memory-only fallback mode
   - Automatic recovery attempts
   - Graceful degradation
   - Quarantine for corrupted files
```

**DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING**:
```python
‚úÖ Error Boundaries:
   - Every disk operation wrapped in try-catch
   - Specific exception handling (IOError, OSError, PickleError)
   - Unknown exceptions don't crash system
   
‚úÖ Recovery Mechanisms:
   - Automatic retry every 5 minutes
   - Health checks before recovery
   - Progressive backoff strategy
   
‚úÖ Resource Management:
   - Doubled memory cache in memory-only mode
   - Cleanup of temp files on failure
   - Quarantine prevents disk filling
```

**CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT**:
- **Design**: Excellent separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test cases provided
- **Maintainability**: Clear method names and documentation
- **Performance**: Fallback completes in <100ms

**VERDICT**: **APPROVED - Exemplary defensive programming**

### üîí Morgan Hayes v2.0 - Security Review

**Reviewing**: Security implications of fixes

**SECURITY ASSESSMENT**:

**C2 Cache Security**:
```python
‚úÖ File System Security:
   - Atomic writes prevent partial files
   - Temp files cleaned up on failure
   - Quarantine prevents malicious file accumulation
   - No path traversal vulnerabilities
   
‚úÖ Data Integrity:
   - Verification after write
   - Corruption detection on read
   - Pickle security considerations noted
```

**C3 Process Security**:
```javascript
‚úÖ Process Security:

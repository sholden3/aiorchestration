@fileoverview Storage package - Persistence layer for governance data
@author Dr. Sarah Chen v1.0 - 2025-08-29
@architecture Backend - Storage layer
@responsibility Manage persistent storage of governance data and audit trails
@dependencies aiofiles, json, sqlite3
@integration_points Audit system, metrics collection, decision cache
@testing_strategy Storage I/O tests, persistence tests, recovery tests
@governance Storage operations are audited and secured

Business Logic Summary:
- Store audit trails
- Persist metrics data
- Cache decisions
- Archive validations
- Manage configurations

Architecture Integration:
- Async file operations
- Database connections
- Cache management
- Archive rotation
- Backup strategies

Sarah's Framework Check:
- What breaks first: Disk full during audit write
- How we know: I/O errors and write failures
- Plan B: Memory buffer with rotation to cloud

Storage Components:
- Audit trail storage
- Metrics database
- Decision cache
- Configuration store
- Archive management

Storage Locations:
- .governance/audit/: Audit trail files
- .governance/metrics/: Metrics database
- .governance/cache/: Decision cache
- .governance/config/: Runtime configs
- .governance/archive/: Historical data

Note: Storage implementation planned.
Currently using file-based logging.

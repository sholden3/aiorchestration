## SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS
1. {{requirement_1}}
2. {{requirement_2}}
3. {{requirement_3}}
4. {{requirement_4}}
5. {{requirement_5}}

## SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing APIs
- **Database Patterns**: Follow existing database patterns in {{database_patterns}}
- **Caching Strategy**: Use current caching strategies from {{cache_patterns}}
- **Testing Requirements**: Preserve all existing tests and add comprehensive new tests (>85% coverage)
- **Documentation**: Update documentation following governance standards

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### 1. Analysis Phase (30 minutes)
- Review current implementation and identify specific architectural violations
- Analyze dependencies and potential impact of changes
- Identify patterns that need refactoring
- Document current performance baselines

### 2. Design Phase (45 minutes)
- Create improved architecture following SOLID principles
- Design domain-driven structure if applicable
- Plan incremental refactoring approach
- Design comprehensive test strategy

### 3. Implementation Phase (2-3 hours)
- Refactor incrementally with comprehensive testing after each step
- Implement new architecture patterns
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Update configuration and documentation

### 4. Validation Phase (30 minutes)
- Ensure all governance requirements are met
- Run complete test suite
- Validate performance improvements
- Verify security compliance

## SAFETY PROTOCOLS
{{safety_checks}}

## ROLLBACK PLAN
{{rollback_procedures}}

## QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] New architecture follows SOLID principles
- [ ] Database patterns consistent with existing system
- [ ] Caching strategy optimized
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Logging appropriate and consistent
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate
- [ ] Tests comprehensive (>85% coverage)
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Security patterns followed
- [ ] Code review ready

## FOCUS AREAS
Create maintainable, scalable, and testable architecture while maintaining system reliability and following all governance protocols. Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION
1. Run full test suite and ensure 100% pass rate
2. Verify performance benchmarks
3. Validate security scan results
4. Confirm documentation accuracy
5. Test rollback procedures
6. Update architectural decision records

**Remember**: You are implementing changes to a production system. Every change must be thoroughly tested, documented, and follow established patterns. When in doubt, choose the safer, more maintainable approach.

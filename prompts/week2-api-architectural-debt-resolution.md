# Claude Research & Development - Week 2: API Architectural Debt Resolution

**Project Path**: `C:\Users\wesho\Desktop\WorkProjects\ClaudeCodeEnhancements\ClaudeResearchAndDevelopment`  
**Current Phase**: Week 2 - H2 API Architectural Debt  
**Orchestrator**: Alexandra "Alex" Voss - Senior Technical Orchestrator  

## üîç INITIAL PROJECT CONTEXT REVIEW

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before proceeding with any architectural work, please:

1. **Re-read CLAUDE.md** - Ensure full understanding of project context, standards, and best practices
2. **Review STATUS.md** - Confirm current project state and Week 1 completion status  
3. **Validate TRACKER.md** - Understand H2 objectives and Week 2 deliverables
4. **Check governance/config.yaml** - Ensure compliance with established governance standards

**Project Foundation Status**: 
‚úÖ Week 1 Complete: Consistent naming conventions and centralized configuration management established  
üéØ Week 2 Objective: API Architectural Debt resolution with domain-driven structure

---

## üéØ WEEK 2 MISSION: API ARCHITECTURAL DEBT RESOLUTION

### **Primary Objectives**

1. **Root Module Mapping**: Comprehensive analysis of 47+ root modules
2. **Domain-Driven Architecture Design**: Create logical domain boundaries
3. **Incremental Refactoring Strategy**: Plan systematic API restructuring
4. **Governance Compliance**: Maintain 95% governance standards throughout

### **Success Criteria**
- Complete inventory of all root modules with dependency mapping
- Domain-driven architecture blueprint aligned with project standards
- Incremental refactoring roadmap with risk assessment
- Governance validation at each architectural decision point

## üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOL**

**For ALL Code Changes and Bug Fixes**:

**Claude's Role**: 
- Analyze the problem
- Design the solution
- **Generate GitHub Copilot Prompts** (NOT implement directly)
- Provide comprehensive file context for Copilot

**GitHub Copilot Integration Workflow**:
1. **Claude Analysis**: Identify the issue and design solution approach
2. **Copilot Prompt Generation**: Claude provides specific prompts with full file contents
3. **Human-Copilot Implementation**: Human uses Claude's prompts with GitHub Copilot
4. **Claude Review**: After implementation, Claude reviews the changes
5. **Iteration**: Repeat as needed for optimization

**Copilot Prompt Format**:
```
PROMPT FOR GITHUB COPILOT:
File: [full file path]
Objective: [specific change needed]
Context: [relevant architectural context]

Current File Contents:
[complete file contents]

Instructions for Copilot:
[detailed, specific instructions for the change]
[architectural considerations]
[governance compliance requirements]
```

## üèóÔ∏è WEEK 2 ARCHITECTURAL FOCUS AREAS

### **1. Root Module Mapping & Analysis**

**Immediate Actions**:
- Systematically catalog all root modules in the codebase
- Create dependency relationship mapping
- Identify architectural debt patterns
- Document coupling and cohesion issues

**Expected Deliverables**:
- Complete root module inventory (47+ modules)
- Dependency graph visualization
- Architectural debt assessment report
- Domain boundary identification

### **2. Domain-Driven Structure Design**

**Design Principles**:
- Align with existing governance standards
- Respect current Angular 17 + FastAPI architecture
- Maintain compatibility with existing test coverage (85-93%)
- Integrate with established documentation patterns

**Architecture Considerations**:
- Microservices vs. modular monolith evaluation
- API gateway patterns for domain separation
- Database schema alignment with domain boundaries
- Event-driven communication patterns

### **3. Incremental Refactoring Strategy**

**Refactoring Approach**:
- Risk-based prioritization (high-impact, low-risk first)
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Test coverage preservation during transitions
- Governance compliance throughout process

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase 1: Low-risk module restructuring
- Phase 2: API boundary refinement
- Phase 3: Database schema alignment
- Phase 4: Integration testing and validation

## üéØ ORCHESTRATOR GUIDANCE (Alexandra "Alex" Voss)

### **Technical Leadership Approach**

**Architectural Decision Making**:
- Every structural change must be justified with business value
- Maintain extreme governance compliance (95% standard)
- Document architectural decisions in DECISIONS.md
- Validate against existing project patterns

**Risk Management**:
- Identify potential breaking changes early
- Plan rollback strategies for each refactoring phase
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage during transitions
- Validate governance compliance at each milestone

**Quality Assurance**:
- Code reviews after each Copilot implementation
- Architectural pattern validation
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation updates with each structural change

---

## üîß TACTICAL EXECUTION PLAN

### **Week 2 Daily Workflow**

**Day 1-2: Discovery & Mapping**
```
1. Run comprehensive `structure-review` 
2. Execute `code-review` focusing on module analysis
3. Generate root module inventory
4. Create dependency mapping
```

**Day 3-4: Domain Design**
```
1. Analyze module relationships
2. Design domain boundaries
3. Create architectural blueprint
4. Validate against governance standards
```

**Day 5-7: Refactoring Strategy**
```
1. Prioritize refactoring targets
2. Design incremental implementation plan
3. Create Copilot prompts for initial changes
4. Begin implementation with Copilot integration
```

### **Governance Integration Checkpoints**

**Before Each Major Change**:
- Run `governance-check` for compliance validation
- Execute existing validators for affected components
- Update relevant documentation (STATUS.md, TRACKER.md)
- Validate test coverage maintenance

**After Each Implementation**:
- Review Copilot-generated changes
- Run comprehensive testing suite
- Update architectural documentation
- Commit with governance hook validation
